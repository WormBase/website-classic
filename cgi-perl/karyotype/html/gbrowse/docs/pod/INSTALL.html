<a href="/gbrowse/docs/pod//BIOSQL_ADAPTER_HOWTO.html">the BIOSQL_ADAPTER_HOWTO manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>The browser consists of a CGI script named &quot;gbrowse&quot;, a Perl module
that handles some of the gory details, a small number of static image
files, and a configuration directory that contains configuration files
for each data source. The correct locations of these CGI script,
configuration directory and static files depend on how Apache was
installed on your system, which varies from operating system to
operating system, and are controlled by the following installation
options:</p>
<pre>
   CGI script:      /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/gbrowse
   Static images:   /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gbrowse
   Config files:    /usr/local/apache/conf/gbrowse.conf
   The module:      -standard site-specific Perl library location-</pre>
<p>You can change change the location of the installation by passing
Makefile.PL one or more NAME=VALUE pairs, like so:</p>
<pre>
  perl Makefile.PL CONF=/etc HTDOCS=/home/html</pre>
<p>This will cause the configuration files to be installed in
/etc/gbrowse.conf and the static files to be installed in
/home/html/gbrowse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this isn't usually necessary. The Makefile.PL script
attempts to guess the appropriate directory locations for your system,
but sometimes you will have to specify them manually. For example, if
you are on an unusual system, where the Apache installation uses
/opt/www/html for HTML files, /opt/run/cgi-bin for CGI scripts, and
/etc/httpd/conf for the configuration files, you should specify the
following configuration: perl Makefile.PL HTDOCS=/opt/www/html \
CONF=/etc/httpd/conf \ CGIBIN=/opt/run/cgi-bin</p>
<p>As a convenience, you can use the configuration option APACHE, in
which case the static and CGI files will be placed into APACHE/conf,
APACHE/htdocs and APACHE/cgi-bin respectively, where APACHE is the
location you specified on the command line:</p>
<pre>
  perl Makefile.PL APACHE=/home/www</pre>
<p>Note that the configuration files are always placed in a subdirectory
named gbrowse.conf.  You cannot change this.  Similarly, the static
files are placed in a directory named gbrowse.  The install script
will detect if there are already configuration files in the selected
directory and not overwrite them if so.  The same applies to the
cascading stylesheet file (gbrowse.css) located in the gbrowse
subdirectory.  However, neither the GIF files in the &quot;buttons&quot;
subdirectory nor the plugin modules in the gbrowse.conf/plugins
directory are checked before overwriting them, so be careful to copy
the new copies somewhere safe if you have modified them.</p>
<p>The DO_XS flag, if true (perl Makefile.PL DO_XS=1), will compile a
small C subroutine for nucleotide alignments.  This will vastly improve
the performance of the gbrowse_details script when displaying alignments.
To use this feature, you will need a C compiler.</p>
<p>You can always manually move the files around after install.  See
<a href="/gbrowse/docs/pod//CONFIGURE_HOWTO.html">the CONFIGURE_HOWTO manpage</a> for details.</p>
<p>When installing the static files, the install script also creates an
empty directory named &quot;tmp&quot;. This directory is set to be world
writable so that the GBrowse server can use it to manage temporary
image files that it creates on the fly. If you would prefer not to
have a world writable directory on your system, simply change the
ownership and permissions to allow the web server account to write
into it. The directory is located in HTDOCS/gbrowse/tmp by default.</p>
<p>The first time you run Makefile.PL, a file named GGB.def will be
created your file path settings. When Makefile.PL is run again, it
will ask you whether you wish to reuse the settings stored in the
file.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="4__installing_into_your_home_directory">4. INSTALLING INTO YOUR HOME DIRECTORY</a></h2>
<p>Read this section only if you are on a Unix system and do not have
root privileges. You will need to configure Apache to run out of your
home directory.  One way to do this is to install Apache from source
code and to specify your home directory when you first configure it:</p>
<pre>
   % cd apache_x.xx.xx
   % ./configure --prefix=$HOME/apache
   % make
   % make install</pre>
<p>This will place Apache into your home directory under ~/apache.  You
should then edit ~/apache/conf/httpd.conf and replace the directive:</p>
<pre>
  Listen 80</pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre>
  Listen 8000</pre>
<p>so that Apache will listen for connections to the unprivileged port
8000 rather than the usual port 80.  If you also see a &quot;Port 80&quot;
directive, change it to read &quot;Port 8000.&quot; You will now be able to talk
to Apache using URLs like <a href="http://your.host.edu:8000/.">http://your.host.edu:8000/.</a></p>
<p>You may not need to install Apache from scratch if your Unix
distribution already has Apache installed.  What you will do is to
create an Apache directory tree in your home directory and then start
Apache using command-line arguments that tell it to start up from the
home directory rather than its default system-wide directory.</p>
<p>Create an Apache directory and its subdirectories using the following
series of commands:</p>
<pre>
  % cd ~
  % mkdir apache
  % mkdir apache/conf
  % mkdir apache/logs
  % mkdir apache/htdocs
  % mkdir apache/cgi-bin</pre>
<p>Now copy the system-wide httpd.conf into ~/apache/conf.  You may need
to search around a bit to find out where the system-wide httpd.conf
lives (try running the command &quot;locate httpd.conf&quot;):</p>
<pre>
  % cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf ~/apache/conf</pre>
<p>Now open up ~/apache/conf/httpd.conf with a text editor and add the
following four directives, replacing $HOME with the full path to your
home directory (for example &quot;/home/fred&quot;):</p>
<pre>
  Listen       8000
  ServerRoot   $HOME/apache
  DocumentRoot $HOME/apache/htdocs
  SetEnv       PERL5LIB $HOME/lib</pre>
<p>You should search the httpd.conf file for older versions of these
directives, and delete them if they are there.  If you see a Port
directive, change it to read &quot;Port 8000&quot;.</p>
<p>Somewhere in httpd.conf there will be a ScriptAlias directives, as
well as a &lt;Directory&gt; section that refers to &quot;cgi-bin&quot;.  Delete the
ScriptAlias directive and the entire &lt;Directory&gt; section through to
the &lt;/Directory&gt; line.  Replace both these sections with the
following:</p>
<pre>
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ &quot;cgi-bin/&quot;</pre>
<pre>
 &lt;Location &quot;/cgi-bin&quot;&gt;
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
 &lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
<p>You can now start Apache from the command line using the &quot;apachectl&quot;
script:</p>
<pre>
 % /usr/sbin/apachectl -d ~/apache -k start</pre>
<p>If Apache starts successfully, then this command will return silently.
Otherwise, it will print an error message.  More error messages may be
found in ~/apache/logs/error_log.</p>
<p>To confirm that Apache is running from your home directory, create a
file named index.html and copy it into ~/apache/htdocs.  You should
then be able to open a browser, connect to <a href="http://localhost:8000/,">http://localhost:8000/,</a> and
see the index.html file that you just created.</p>
<p>Now you can build and install gbrowse with the following incantation:</p>
<pre>
 % cd Generic-Genome-Browser-X.XX
 % perl Makefile.PL APACHE=~/apache LIB=~/lib BIN=~/bin NONROOT=1
 % make
 % make install</pre>
<p>When you are prompted to load gbrowse using <a href="http://localhost/gbrowse,">http://localhost/gbrowse,</a>
use <a href="http://localhost:8000/gbrowse">http://localhost:8000/gbrowse</a> instead.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="5__try_the_browser_out">5. TRY THE BROWSER OUT</a></h2>
<p>The installation procedure will create a small in-memory database of
yeast chromosome 1 for you to play with.  To try the browser out, use
your favorite browser to open:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse">http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse</a></pre>
<p>Try searching for &quot;I&quot; (the name of the first chromosome of yeast), or
a gene such as NUT21 or TCF3.  Then try searching for &quot;membrane
trafficking.&quot;</p>
<p>For your interest, the feature and DNA files for this database is
located in the Apache document root at
gbrowse/databases/yeast_chr1.  The configuration file is in the web
server configuration directory under gbrowse.conf/yeast1.conf.</p>
<p>More configuration information and a short tutorial are located at:</p>
<pre>
   <a href="http://localhost/gbrowse">http://localhost/gbrowse</a></pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="6__populating_the_database__mysql_">6. POPULATING THE DATABASE (MySQL)</a></h2>
<p>This step takes you through populating the database with the full
yeast genome.  You can skip this step if you use the in-memory
database for small projects (see section 6).</p>
<p>Remember as well that there are other datbase possibilities. For
example you could also use BioSQL (Mysql, Postgres, Oracle) or
Chado (Postgres). See <a href="/gbrowse/docs/pod//ORACLE_AND_POSTGRESQL.html">the ORACLE_AND_POSTGRESQL manpage</a> for more.</p>
<p>This example uses Mysql as it is relatively 
easy to set up.</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<pre>
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'create database yeast'
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant all privileges on yeast.* to me@localhost'
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant file on *.* to me@localhost'
  mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant select on yeast.* to nobody@localhost'</pre>
<pre>
  bp_bulk_load_gff.pl -d yeast sample_data/yeast_data.gff</pre>
<p>Details:</p>
<pre>
 Note: This section refers to the user account under which Apache runs
 as &quot;nobody&quot; because that is the most common case. However, many
 systems use a different user account. Mac OSX uses &quot;www&quot;, Fedora Core
 uses &quot;apache&quot; and Ubuntu uses &quot;www-data.&quot; In the instructions that
 follow, replace 'nobody' with the appropriate Apache account name.</pre>
<p>You will need an installation of MySQL for this section. Using the
mysql command line, create a database (called &quot;yeast&quot; in the synopsis
above), and ensure that you have update and file privileges on it. The
example above assumes that you have a username of &quot;me&quot; and that you
will allow updates from the local machine only. It also gives all
privileges to &quot;me&quot;. You may be comfortable with a more restricted set
of privileges, but be sure to provide at least SELECT, UPDATE and
INSERT privileges. You will need to provide the administrator's name
and correct password for these commands to succeed.</p>
<p>In addition, grant the &quot;nobody&quot; user the SELECT privilege. The web
server usually runs as nobody, and must be able to make queries on the
database. Modify this as needed if the web server runs under a
different account.</p>
<p>The next step is to load the database with data. This is accomplished
by loading the database from a tab-delimited file containing the
genomic annotations in GFF format. The Bioperl distribution comes with
three tools for loading Bio::DB::GFF databases:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="bp_load_gff_pl" class="item">bp_load_gff.pl</a></strong>

<p>This will incrementally load a database, optionally initializing
it if it does not already exist.  This script will work correctly
even if the MySQL server is located on another host.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="bp_bulk_load_gff_pl" class="item">bp_bulk_load_gff.pl</a></strong>

<p>This Perl script will initialize a new Bio::DB::GFF database with
a fresh schema, deleting anything that was there before.  It will
then load the file.  Only suitable for use the very first time
you create a database, or when you want to start from scratch!
The bulk loader is as much as 10x faster than bp_load_gff.pl, but
does not work in the situation in which the MySQL database
is running on a remote host.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="bp_fast_load_gff_pl" class="item">bp_fast_load_gff.pl</a></strong>

<p>This will incrementally load a database.  On UNIX systems, it will
activate a fast loader that makes the speed almost the same as
the bulk loader.  Be careful, though, because this is an experimental
piece of software.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You will find these scripts in the Bioperl distribution, in the
subdirectory scripts/Bio-DB-GFF. If you requested that Bioperl scripts
be installed during installation, they will also be found in your
command path.</p>
<p>For testing purposes, this distribution includes a GFF file with yeast
genome annotations. The file can be found in the test_data
subdirectory. If the load is successful, you should see a message
indicating that 13298 features were successfully loaded.</p>
<p>Provided that the yeast load was successful, you may now run &quot;make
test&quot;. This invokes a small test script that tests that the database
is accessible by the &quot;nobody&quot; user and that the basic feature
retrieval functions are working.</p>
<p>You may also wish to load the yeast DNA, so that you can test the
three-frame translation and GC content features of the
browser. Because of its size, the file containing the complete yeast
genome is distributed separately and can be downloaded from:</p>
<p><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gmod/yeast.fasta.gz?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gmod/yeast.fasta.gz</a></p>
<p>Load the file with this command:</p>
<pre>
  bp_load_gff.pl -d yeast -fasta yeast.fasta.gz &lt;/dev/null</pre>
<p>You should now be able to browse the yeast genome.  Type the following
URL into your favorite browser:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://name.of.your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse/yeast">http://name.of.your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse/yeast</a></pre>
<p>This will display the genome browser instructions and a search field.
Type in &quot;III&quot; to start searching chromosome III, or search for
&quot;glucose&quot; to find a bunch of genes that are involved in glucose
metabolism.</p>
<p>*IF YOU GET AN ERROR* examine the Apache server error log (depending
on how Apache was installed, it may be located in
/usr/local/apache/logs/, /var/log/httpd/, /var/log/apache, or
elsewhere).  Usually there will be an informative error message in the
error log.  The most common problem is MySQL password or permissions
problems.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="7_gff3_loading">7.GFF3 Loading</a></h2>
<p>An increasing number of model organism databases are distributing
genome annotation in GFF3 format. An example of this format can be
found at SGD at
<a href="ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/chromosomal_feature/saccharomyces_verevisiae.gff.">ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/chromosomal_feature/saccharomyces_verevisiae.gff.</a> Although
these files will load into the standard Bio::DB::GFF database, some of
the features of GFF3, such as the ability to represent multiple
alternative splice forms as a single gene, will be lost. We suggest
instead that you use a Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store database.</p>
<p>Here is a quick recipe.</p>
<p>Get a gff3 file (available from SGD, WormBase, FlyBase and many other
sites) and save it as genome.gff3.  Then launch the mysql command-line
client and run commands similar to these (be sure to replace the
example user names with correct ones as described earlier).</p>
<pre>
     mysql -uroot -p password -e 'create database genomegff3'
     mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant all privileges on genomegff3.* to me@localhost'
     mysql -uroot -p password -e 'grant select on genomegff3.* to nobody@localhost'</pre>
<pre>
     bp_seqfeature_load.pl -d genomegff3 -f -c genome.gff3</pre>
<p>Create a GBrowse config file by copying one of the existing examples,
and modify the top lines to read like the following:</p>
<pre>
 db_adaptor    = Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store
 db_args       = -adaptor DBI::mysql
                 -dsn     dbi:mysql:database=genomegff3
                 -user    nobody</pre>
<p>The database should now be browsable. For more details, see
Generic-Genome-Browser/README.gff3</p>

<p>In addition, the bin/ subdirectory of the GBrowse distribution
contains a series of scripts to convert annotation files in various
formats into GFF2 or GFF3 format. For example, the ucsc_genes2gff.pl
script will convert gene models in Table Browser format files from
<a href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu">http://www.genome.ucsc.edu</a> into GFF3 format.</p>
<p>load_genbank.pl will download and load sequence annotation files in
GenBank format from NCBI. The sample configuration file
08.genbank.conf (located in contrib/conf_files) is appropriate for
data loaded with load_genbank.pl.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="9__loading_dna">9. LOADING DNA</a></h2>
<p>To display the DNA sequence and to run sequence-dependent glyphs such
as the three-frame translation, you will need to load the DNA as well
as the annotations.  The DNA must be formatted as a series of one or
more FASTA-format files in which each entry in the file corresponds to
a top-level sequence such as a chromosome pseudomolecule.  You can
then run the bp_load_gff.pl or bp_bulk_load_gff.pl script using the
-fasta argument.  For example, if the yeast genome is contained in a
FASTA file named yeast.fa, you would run the command:</p>
<pre>
  bp_bulk_load_gff.pl -d yeast -fasta yeast.fa sample/yeast_data.gff</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you may put several FASTA files into a directory, and
provide the directory name as the argument to -fasta.</p>
<p>(The yeast DNA is too large to be included in this distribution, but
you can get a copy of it from
<a href="ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/">ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/</a>)</p>
<p>Run &quot;bp_bulk_load_gff.pl -h&quot; to see usage instructions.</p>
<p>Newer versions of GFF (the so-called &quot;GFF2.5&quot; and &quot;GFF3&quot; formats)
include the DNA at the bottom of the file, following the sequence
annotations.  If you are loading one of these GFF files, the DNA will
be recognized automatically and loaded by any of the loaders.</p>

<h2><a name="10__creating_your_own_genome_database">10. CREATING YOUR OWN GENOME DATABASE</a></h2>
<p>See the file doc/pod/CONFIGURE_HOWTO.pod for information on how to
create new databases from scratch, add new browser tracks, and how to
get the browser to dump the DNA from the region currently under
display.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="11__making_the_browser_run_faster">11. MAKING THE BROWSER RUN FASTER</a></h2>
<p>Three factors are major contributors to the length of time it takes to
load a gbrowse page:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Loading the Perl interpreter and parsing BioPerl and all the 
other Perl libraries that gbrowse uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query speed on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conversion at the Perl layer of database data into BioPerl
objects for rendering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To improve (1), we recommend that you install the mod_perl module for
Apache. (<a href="http://perl.apache.org">http://perl.apache.org</a>).  By configuring an Apache::Registry
directory and placing gbrowse inside it (rather than in the default
cgi-bin directory). The overhead for loading Perl and its libraries
are eliminated, thereby increasing the performance of the script
noticeably.</p>
<p>Be aware that there is a bad interaction between the Apache::DBI
module (often used to speed up database accesses) and Bio::DB::GFF.
This will cause the GFF dumper plugin to fail intermittently.  GBrowse
does not need Apache::DBI to achieve performance increases under
mod_perl and it is suggested that you disable Apache::DBI.  If you
cannot do this, then you should remove the file GFFDumper.pm from the
gbrowse.conf/plugins directory.</p>
<p>Database query performance (2) is also a major factor.  If you are
using MySQL as the backend, you will see dramatic performance
increases by increasing the amount of memory available to the key
buffer, sort buffer, table cache and other in-memory data structures.
we suggest that you replace the default MySQL configuration file
(usually stored in /etc/my.cnf) with one of the large-memory sample
configuration files provided in the support-files subdirectory of the
MySQL distribution.  Of course, if you tell MySQL to use more memory
than you have, then performance will degrade again.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a slowdown when gbrowse converts the results of
database SQL queries into renderable biological objects.  This becomes
particularly noticeable when there are lots of multi-segment objects
to be displayed.  You can work around this slowdown by using semantic
zooming (see <a href="/gbrowse/docs/pod//CONFIGURE_HOWTO.html">the CONFIGURE_HOWTO manpage</a>).  Otherwise, there's not much
that can be done about this short of buying a faster machine.
The GMOD team is working hard to reduce this performance hit.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="12__making_the_server_run_safer">12. MAKING THE SERVER RUN SAFER</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you are running a server-side Web script using information
provided by a web client, there is a risk that maliciously-formatted
data provided by the use will trick the server-side script into
performing some unintentional action, such as modifying a file on the
server.  Perl's &quot;taint&quot; checks are designed to catch places in the
code where such malicious data could cause harm, and GBrowse has been
tested extensively with these taint checks activated.</p>
<p>Because of taint checks' noticeable impact on performance, they have
been turned off in the distributed version of gbrowse.  If you wish to
reactivate the extra checking (at the expense of a performance hit),
go to the file &quot;gbrowse&quot; located in the Web scripts directory and edit
the top line of the file to read:</p>
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T</pre>
<p>The -T switch turns on taint checks.</p>
<p>If you are running GBrowse under mod_perl, add the following line to
the httpd.conf configuration file:</p>
<pre>
  PerlTaintCheck  On</pre>
<p>This will affect all mod_perl scripts globally.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="13__the_gbrowse_img_script">13. THE GBROWSE_IMG SCRIPT</a></h2>
<p>The gbrowse_img CGI script is a stripped-down version of gbrowse which
just generates images.  It is suitable for incorporating into &lt;img&gt;
tags in order to make a thumbnail of a region of interest.  The
thumbnail can then be linked to the full-featured gbrowse.  Here is an
example of how this works using the WormBase site:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse/wormbase?name=mec-3">http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse/wormbase?name=mec-3</a>&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse_img/wormbase?name=mec-3;width=200">http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse_img/wormbase?name=mec-3;width=200</a>&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p>This will generate a 200-pixel inline image of the region.  Clicking
on the image will link to the fully-navigable gbrowse script.</p>
<p>You can also use gbrowse_img to superimpose temporary features (like
BLAST hits) on the existing genome features.</p>
<p>If the script is called without CGI arguments, it will generate usage
instructions. Select <a href="http://your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse_img">http://your.host/cgi-bin/gbrowse_img</a> to see this
internal documentation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="14__plugins">14. PLUGINS</a></h2>
<p>Gbrowse has a plugin architecture which makes it easy for third-party
developers to expand its functionality.  The plugins are Perl .pm
files located in the directory gbrowse.conf/plugins/.  To install
plugins, simply copy them into this directory.  To uninstall, remove
them.</p>
<p>If you wish to install your own or third party plugins, it is
suggested that you create a separate directory outside the
gbrowse.conf/ hierarchy in which to store them and then to indicate
the location of these plugins using the plugin_path setting:</p>
<pre>
  plugin_path = /usr/local/gbrowse_plugins</pre>
<p>This setting should be somewhere in the [GENERAL] section of the
relevant gbrowse configuration file.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="15__the_genbank_embl_proxy">15. THE GENBANK/EMBL PROXY</a></h2>
<p>Sample configuration number 5 (&quot;05.embl.conf&quot;) corresponds to a
pass-through proxy for Genbank. At least in theory, if you enter a
landmark that isn't recognized, gbrowse will go to EMBL using the
bioperl BioFetch facility, parse the record, and enter it into the
local database. This allows you to browse arbitrary
Genbank/EMBL/Refseq entries.</p>
<p>This functionality is not well supported, but here is a recipe for giving
it a try:</p>
<p>Create a local database named &quot;embl&quot; and initialize it this way:</p>
<p>Set up permissions for this database so that &quot;nobody@localhost&quot; has
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges</p>
<p>Initialize the database for use with this command:</p>
<pre>
 % bp_load_gff.pl -c -d embl</pre>
<p>If you need to use a proxy to access remote web sites, uncomment the
-proxy line in the conf file, and adjust the URL of the proxy as
appropriate.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse/embl">http://localhost/cgi-bin/gbrowse/embl</a>. Search for a Genbank or
embl accession number, such as CEF58D5</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="16__removing_out_of_date_image_files">16. REMOVING OUT-OF-DATE IMAGE FILES</a></h2>
<p>As GBrowse runs, it creates temporary image files in the gbrowse tmp
directory (typically HTDOCS/gbrowse/tmp). These image files are
relatively small, but if you run GBrowse for a long time they may
begin consuming significant amounts of disk space. The following Unix
shell commands will remove old image files and unused directories:</p>
<pre>
   cd HTDOCS/gbrowse/tmp
   find . -type f -atime +20 -print -exec rm {} \;
   find . -type d -empty -depth -exec rmdir {} \;</pre>
<p>Be sure to replace HTDOCS with the path to your web server HTML
document root directory. You might want to run this command under
cron, but be sure that the user that the cron job runs under has the
proper permissions. You may need to install it in root's cron script.</p>

<h2><a name="17__the_balloon_tooltips">17. THE BALLOON TOOLTIPS</a></h2>
<p>The balloon tooltip effect requires the balloon javascript files and the
background balloon images files. You can download them from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wormbase.org/wiki/index.php/Balloon_Tooltips">http://www.wormbase.org/wiki/index.php/Balloon_Tooltips</a></p>
<p>Copy balloon.js, yahoo-dom-event.js and prototype.js into the folder:</p>
<pre>
  $HTDOCS/gbrowse/js</pre>
<p>where $HTDOCS is the path to your apache HTML files. For example, if
your apache installation path is D:/apache, copy those js files into:</p>
<p>D:/apache/htdocs/gbrowse/js</p>
<p>And then copy all balloon image files into the folder:</p>
<pre>
  $HTDOCS/images/balloons</pre>
