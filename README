This is the software needed for the WormBase site.  It is a bunch of
HTML files and ModPerl Apache::Registry scripts, plus a small number of
Java applets.

It does not include:

	- The wormbase data.
	- Other software packages.

See the file INSTALL.txt for detailed installation instructions.
INSTALL.html has the same information in HTML format.

Please send questions and requests for support to
wormbase-dev@wormbase.org.
