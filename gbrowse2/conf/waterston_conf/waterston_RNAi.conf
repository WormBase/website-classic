 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 small RNAs (&lt;200bp) were isolated from embryos, and sequenced using Illumina technology. We show changes in expression levels for each miRNA feature. 
 </p>
 <h2>Series Description</h2>
 We report a significant number of miRNAs and other non-coding small RNAs show dramatic changes in expression during aging in C. elegans. RNAs were prepared from four diffrent timepoints during adulthood of C. elegans hermaphrodites, Day 0, 5, 8 and 12 post-L4 molt, and used for making cDNA libraries for small RNAs. Each library was sequenced using recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology, Solexa. This study should lead to a better understanding of the aging process and age-related diseases.

 <h2>Details</h2>
 <p>
 small RNAs (&lt;200bp) were isolated from spe-9 adults 5 days post-L4, and sequenced using Illumina technology. We show changes in expression levels for each miRNA feature. 
 </p>
 <h2>Series Description</h2>
 We report a significant number of miRNAs and other non-coding small RNAs show dramatic changes in expression during aging in C. elegans. RNAs were prepared from four diffrent timepoints during adulthood of C. elegans hermaphrodites, Day 0, 5, 8 and 12 post-L4 molt, and used for making cDNA libraries for small RNAs. Each library was sequenced using recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology, Solexa. This study should lead to a better understanding of the aging process and age-related diseases.
