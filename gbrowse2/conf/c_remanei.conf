               <a name="curation_anomalies">About the Curation Anomaly tracks</a>: The
               curation anomaly tracks show data that appear to conflict with the existing
               curated gene models.</p>

               <p>There will also be data that supports the gene models; this supporting
               evidence is not highlighted in these curation anomaly tracks. The curation 
               anomaly track only gives an indication of potential problems with the gene 
               models and may therefore give the false impression that some models are
               incorrect.</p>

               <p>Both the supporting evidence and any conflicting anomaly data is taken
               into consideration when the gene model is curated.</p>

	       <p>The curators continue to amend gene models as new data becomes available
               and will concentrate their efforts on genes which appear to be the most in
               need of attention.</p>

               <p>If you have concerns about the correctness of any particular gene model,
               please email: help@wormbase.org together with any supporting evidence
               you may have for making a change.</p>
