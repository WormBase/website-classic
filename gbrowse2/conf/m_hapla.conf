citation = Meloidogyne hapla gene sets are merged transcripts from TIGR and Erich Schwarz's Augustus set. Overlapping transcripts were merged on the same strand into genes. Isoforms that are substrings of another, based on 100% DNA and exon boundary identity and no internal stops in the larger one, were removed.
