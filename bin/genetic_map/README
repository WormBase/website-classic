2005.11.16 - Building a GBrowse-based genetic map
--------------------------------------------------

Creating a new GBrowse-based genetic map.

Required data sets
1) genetic markers in genetic coordinates                                     DONE
2) genetic markers in sequence coordinates (chromosomal bp) which we have     DON'T HAVE YET
3) genetic markers in physical contig coordinates (fmap units)                DON'T HAVE YET

4) genetic markers with confidence intervals                                  DUMP TOMORROW

5) contigs in genetic coordinates
6) contigs in contig coordinates (fmap units) (which we have)
7) contigs in sequence coordinates (chromosomal bp) (we have)



Tracks:
All genes
Genetic markers (that have been used in 3-factor mapping)
Genetic markers (that have been placed on pmap)

Confidence intervals for strictly genetic markers
Snip-SNPs
SNPs




-----

1.  Dump out markers, genetic confidence intervals, etc

 $ bin/dump_markers.pl

Columns are:
0	Chromosome
1	WBGene ID
2	Molecuar_name
3	Public_name
4	Start (bp)
5	Stop  (bp)
6	Strand
7	Map   (Map or Interpolated_map_position)
8	Type (one of mapped or interpolated)



3.  Find the maximal limits of the chromosome according to the genetic
    map and physical map:


  $ genet








Notes from SAB:

Defining the set
Take all genes that have been used as flanking markers to create set
From that set remove all those that have only an inferred map position

Seperate tracks:
	Deletions
	Duplications (JAH - of decreasing utility)
	SNPs - predicted
	Snip-SNPs
	Deletions that have been used for mapping
		(or in the Rothman set)

Likelihood plug in from Richard

Take fosmids and interpolate them onto the genetic map
	(Sanger will supply
