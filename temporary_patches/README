This directory contains temporary patches applied to either
the GFF or acedb databases to facilitate features on the
WormBase website.

gmap_to_pmap/
   Starting with WS134, I began calculating interpolated
   physical map positions for genetic intervals in order to
   display them on the genome browser.

briggsae_gene_objects/ DEPRECATED WITH RELEASE OF WS133
   Temporary C. briggsae acedb gene objects and gff entries.  

snp_interpolated_map_positions/  DEPRECATED WITH WS152 (FINALLY!)
   Starting with WS133, calculated the interpolated genetic 
   map positions of all SNPs.


motifs/
   Scripts that determine genomic coordinates of protein
   motifs for display on the genome browser.


GeneMarkHMM/
   GeneMarkHMM.gff contains a concatened list of all chromosomes.
   This is a one-off gene prediction that needs to be loaded with
   each release.  Note: I had to post-process the chromsomome
   files because the  group field was broken for every entry..

	Included:
	 - fixing group field
	 - purging CHROMOSOME_
	 - flipping start/stop of - strand features

The gff files containing SNP/RFLP polymorphisms and BAC end reads were lifted
to the new CB3 assembly as follows:

1) Remove suffixes from BAC names in the original GFF file so that end reads
   can be paired from an aggregator.  

   $ zcat briggsae_BAC_END.gff.gz  | perl -pe 's/(Sequence:\S+)\.\S+/$1\"/' >cb25.briggsae_patch.gff

2) Append the SNP/RFLP GFF to the patch file
  
   $ zcat 2006-06-14-briggsae_snps.gff.gz >> cb25.briggsae_patch.gff
   

3) Redo the supercontig GFF from AGP to include strand info

  $ scripts/agp2gff.pl contig component cb25_agp/cb25.agp8_Sep05.agp >>cb25.briggsae_patch.gff
  $ gzip cb25.briggsae_patch.gff

4) lift the patch file to cb3 coordinates

  $ zcat cb25.briggsae_patch.gff.gz | scripts/lift_cb25_2_cb3.pl  >cb3.briggsae_patch.gff
  $ gzip cb3.briggsae_patch.gff

5) remove the patched features from the briggsae databases (where applicable)

6) load the databases (briggsae_CB25_022007 and briggsae_WS170).

7) move the CB3 patch file to the FTP site (/usr/local/ftp/pub/wormbase/genomes/briggsae/genome_feature_tables/GFF2/supplementary.gff.gz)
