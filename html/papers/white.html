               The   structure   and   connectivity    of    the    nervous    system    of    the    nematode    Caenorhabditis
               elegans    has    been    deduced    from    reconstructions    of     electron     micrographs     of     serial
               sections.   The    hermaphrodite    nervous    system    has    a    total    complement    of    302    neurons,
               which    are    arranged    in    an    essentially     invariant     structure.     Neurons     with     similar
               morphologies    and    connectivities    have    been    grouped    together    into    classes;    there     are
               118    such    classes.    Neurons    have    simple    morphologies    with    few,    if     any,     branches.
               Processes   from   neurons   run   in   defined    positions    within    bundles    of    parallel    processes,
               synaptic    connections    being    made    en    passant.    Process    bundles    are    arranged    longitudi-
               nally   and   circumferentially   and    are    Often    adjacent    to    ridges    of    hypodermis.    Neurons
               are    generally    highly    locally    connected,    making    synaptic    connections     with     many     of
               their   neighbours.   Muscle   cells   have   arms   that    run    out    to    process    bundles    containing
               motoneuron   axons.    Here    they    receive    their    synaptic    input    in    defined    regions    along
               the   surface    of    the    bundles,    where    motoneuron    axons    reside.    Most    of    the    morpho-
               logically   identifiable    synaptic    connections    in    a    typical    animal    are    described.    These
               consist   of    about    5000    chemical    synapses,    2000    neuromuscular    junctions    and    600    gap
               junctions.

                                   INTRODUCTION
            The   functional   properties   of   a   nervous   system   are   largely    determined    by    the    characteristics    of
            its   component    neurons    and    the    pattern    of    synaptic    connections    between    them.    Although    great
            progress   has    been    made    this    century    in    understanding    the    manner    in    which    information    is
            coded    within    a    neuron    and    the    process    of    information     transmission     between     neurons     via
            synapses,   little   is   currently   known   about   the   detailed   connectivity   of    networks    of    neurons.    The
            reason   for   this   is   simply   that   a    nervous    system    is    an    enormously    complex    organ.    In    the
            vertebrate   cerebellum   alone,    it    has    been    estimated    that    there    are    more    than    10lø    neurons
            (Braitenberg & Atwood 1958) each making many thousands of synaptic contacts.
              We   have   undertaken   a    complete    reconstruction    of    a    nervous    system    from    electron    micrographs
            of  serial  sections.  We   have   been   able   to   do   this   by   using   a   very   simple,   small   nervous   system,
            that   of   the   soil   nematode   Caenorhabditis   elegans.   The   simplicity   and   consistency    of    structure    of
            the nematode's nervous system attracted the attention of several neuroanatomists at the turn

                              THE MIND OF A WORM                                    3

           of   the   century.   Richard   Goldschmidt   was   perhaps   the    most    notable    of    these;    he    attempted    to
           reconstruct   the   nervous   system   of   the   large   parasitic   nematode    Ascaris    lumbricoides    from    serially
           sectioned     material.     Goldschmidt     and     his     contemporaries      produced      detailed      and      accurate
           descriptions   of   the   sensilla,   the   ganglia   and    the    process    tracts    (Chitwood    &    Chitwood    1974),
           but    the    limited    resolution     of     the     light     microscope     prevented     them     from     unambiguously
           resolving     individual     processes     within     bundles.      Goldschmidt      was      convinced      that      neuron
           processes    anastomosed    extensively    and    that    nervous    tissue    was    therefore    a    syncytial    network.
           He   presented   a   set   of   intriguing   diagrams   representing   the   layout   of    processes    in    the    Ascaris
           nervous   system   in   support   of   his   view   of   the   structure   of   nervous    tissue,    a    view    that    he
           vigorously     defended     (Goldschmidt     1908,     1909).     The     alternative     viewpoint      considered      that
           neurons   are   mononucleate    branched    structures    and    that    their    processes    do    not    anastomose.    It
           is   now   clear   that   this   alternative   viewpoint,   as   espoused   by   his   contemporary    critics,    such    as
           Cajal   (1972),   was    correct.    More    recent    anatomical    studies    with    the    electron    microscope    have
           finally   laid   to   rest   the   reticularists'   view   of   the   nervous   system.   We   have   therefore   not   tried
           to    interpret    Goldschmidt's    connectivity    diagrams,    although    we     have     retained     some     of     the
           names, given to the sensilla and ganglia, that were used by him and his contemporaries.
             In   recent   years,   C.   elegans   has   become   an   object   of   intense   developmental   and   genetical    study.
           The   highly   reproducible   sequence   of   cell   divisions   that    takes    place    during    the    development    of
           this   organism   has   allowed   the   complete   cell   lineage   to   be   determined   from   the    fertilized    zygote
           to   the   mature   adult   (Sulston   1983;   Sulston   et   al.   1983).   Each   differentiated   cell   type   that    is
           produced   at   the   terminal   twigs   on   the   lineage   tree   is   now   known.   Laser    ablation    studies    have
           given   some   insight   into   the   degree   of   cell   autonomy   that   is   involved   in   determining   the   pattern
           of   cell   divisions   and   differentiations   that   occur.   Generally   it   seems   that,   in   C.   elegans,    cells
           behave     fairly     autonomously     during     development,     although     there      are      several      well-defined
           instances    where    regulative    cell-cell    interactions     have     been     demonstrated     (Sulston     &     White
           1980; Kimble 1981 ).
             C.   elegans   was   originally   selected   as    an    organism    worthy    of    extensive    developmental    studies,
           partly   because   it   is   readily   amenable   to   genetic   analysis.   Many   mutants   have    been    isolated    and
           mapped    (Brenner    1974).    The    mutants    that    have    been    isolated    exhibit    a    wide     variety     of
           phenotypes'    some    are    morphological,    some    affect    various     aspects     of     development     and     many
           exhibit   aberrant   behaviour.   Some   of   the    behavioural    mutants    have    been    shown    to    have    defects
           in    muscles    (Waterston    et    al.    1980),    but    many    probably    have    alterations    in    the     nervous
           system   (Lewis   &   Hodgkin   1977;   Chalfie   &   Sulston   1981;   Hedgecock    et    al.    1984).    It    is    hoped
           that   a   detailed   knowledge   of   the   structure   of   the   wild-type   nervous   system   of   C.    elegans    will
           facilitate   the   interpretation   of   the   changes   that   occur   in   such   mutant   nervous   systems.   This    may
           in   turn   shed   some   light   on   the   genetic   control   of   the    developmental    processes    that    ultimately
           give rise to the specifically interconnected group of neurons that make upa nervous system.
             The   reconstructions   that   are   presented   in    this    paper    describe    the    connectivity    of    all    the
           neurons   in   the   nervous   system   of   the   C.    elegans    hermaphrodite    except    those    in    the    pharynx,
           which have been described by Albertson & Thomson (1976). The detailed morphologies of
           the sensilla in the head have been described by Ward et al. (I975), Ware et al. (1975) and
           Wright  (1980);   the   structure   of   the   ventral   cord   has   been   described   by   White   et   al.   (1976)   and
           an   independent   reconstruction   of   the   tail   ganglia   has    been    described    by    Hall    (1977).    Together
           these   papers   give   a   fairly   complete   description   of   the   connectivity,    topography    and    ultrastructure
           of the nervous system in the hermaphrodite. The C. elegans male has a more extensive nervous

                                                                I-2

            system   than   that   of   the   hermaphrodite;   most   of   the   'extra'   nervous   tissue   is    situated    in    the
            tail.   A   partial   reconstruction   of   the   nervous   system   in   the   male   tail    has    been    described    by
            Sulston et al. (1980).
              The   structure   of   the   ventral   cord   of   Ascaris   has   been   deduced    from    reconstructions    of    light
            micrographs  of  serial  sections   (Stretton   et   al.   1978).   In   spite   of   the   enormous   difference   in   size
            between   these   two   nematodes   (10   cm   as   against   1   mm   for   C.   elegans),   the    motoneurons    in    the
            ventral  cord   turn   out   to   be   remarkably   similar,   and   it   has   been   possible   to   identify   equivalent'
            motoneuron   classes   in   the   two    animals.    The    large    size    of    Ascaris    enables    electrophysiological
            techniques  to  be   used   in   the   study   of   its   nervous   system.   Such   studies   have   identified   inhibitory
            and   excitatory    classes    of motoneuron    and    have    shown    that    acetylcholine    is    the    neurotransmitter
            used   by   the   excitatory   motoneurons   (Johnson   &   Stretton    1980).    The    small    size    of    C.    elegans
            precludes   such   electrophysiological   studies    but,    by    analogy,    these    results    may    be    related    to
            the equivalent neurons in C. elegans and so provide clues as to their functional properties.
              Although    reconstructions    of     nervous     tissue     from     electron     micrographs     can     in     principle
            identify  all  focal  synaptic   contacts,   it   is   unlikely   that   the   pattern   of   connectivity   obtained   would
            exactly   represent    the    functional    synaptic    connections    between    neurons.    There    is    evidence    that
            synaptic    transmission    mediated    by    some    peptide    transmitters    acts    over    a     considerable     range
            (Jan  et  al.  1983),  suggesting   that   these   types   of   synapses   may   not   be   localized   at   discrete   focal
            contacts   and   therefore   would   not   be   seen   in   electron    micrographs.    There    are    other    routes    by
            which    transmission    of    information    could    occur    between    neurons    which    are    not    apparent    from
            reconstructions.     Neurohumoral     transmission     is     probably     used     for      transmission      over      long
            distances   and    where    many    targets    may    be    involved;    a    good    candidate    for    a    neurosecretory
            neuron    has    been    found    in    the    pharynx    (Albertson    &    Thomson    1976).    Short-range    transmission
            may   occur   by   means   of   electrical   leakage   currents    or    by    capacitive    coupling    between    processes
            that   run   alongside   each    other    for    long    distances.    However,    in    spite    of    these    limitations,
            high-resolution    reconstructions    provide    a     wealth     of     information     on     the     synaptic     contacts
            between   neurons.   Thus,   of    all    the    currently    available    techniques,    such    reconstructions    probably
            provide   the   most   comprehensive   picture   of   the   synaptic   circuits    of    a    nervous    system    such    as
            that of C. elegans.
              Because   of   the   large   amount   of   information    that    is    involved    in    presenting    the    connectivity
            data,  we  have  tried  to  organize  its   presentation   in   such   a   way   as   to   facilitate   quick   access.   The
            structure   of   a   'canonical'   nervous   system   is   presented,   which   is   in   fact   a    mosaic    of    several
            nervous  systems.   A   general   descriptions   first   given   of   the   structure   of   C.   elegans   and   some   of
            the   salient   features   of   the   nervous   system.   This   is   followed   by   a   detailed   description   of    each
            of   the   neuron   classes   arranged   in   alphabetical   order   in   Appendix   1.   These   descriptions   are   fairly
            self-contained   and   include   morphological    as    well    as    synaptic    data.    There    are    many    references
            in  the  first   section   to   illustrations   in   Appendix   1.   These   appear   as   the   class   name   followed   by
            a  letter,   e.g.   ASE-a.   The   lower   case   letter   indicates   the   diagram   referred   to   in   the   description
            of the neuron class ASE.

                               MATERIALS             AND              METHODS

              The    reconstructed    nervous    systems    described    in    this    study    were    all     derived     from     the
            nematode   Caenorhabditis   elegans   (var.   Bristol);   these   were   cultured   on   lawns   of   E.   coli   grown   on
            agar Petri plates (Brenner 1974).

                   THE MIND OF A WORM                                                                                                    5

             Worms  were  rinsed  off  Petri  plates  and  fixed  in  1%  osmium  tetroxide  in  0.1   M   sodium
           phosphate, pH 7.4 for one hour at 20 øC. Pre-fixing in  glutaraldehyde  was  not  done  in  this  work
           because, although this method gives better preservation  of  fine  structure,  we  found  that  osmium
           alone gave better contrast  to  cell  membranes,  and  this  facilitated  the  resolution  of  process
           outlines in regions of dense neuropile.
             After fixation, the worms were spread on a  thin  layer  of  1%  agar  and  cut  in  half.  The  cut
           worms were covered  with  a  drop  of  molten  1%  agar,  and  blocks  of  agar  containing  a  single
           half worm were cut out. These were dehydrated  through  a  graded  series  of  alcohols  to  propylene
           oxide, then to propylene oxide plus Araldite  (CY  212  resin,  CIBA  Ltd.)  and  then  into  Araldite
           at room temperature overnight.  The  following  day  they  were  transferred  to  fresh  Araldite  and
           polymerized in gelatin capsules overnight at 60 øC.
             An LKB  ultratome  III  was  used  with  a  diamond  knife  to  cut  transverse  serial  sections  of
           approximately  50  nm  thickness.  Ribbons  of  sections  were   generally   picked   up   on   Formvar
           coated 75-mesh copper grids. The sections in the  region  of  the  head,  where  most  of  the  nervous
           system is situated, were picked up on slot grids, as it  was  found  to  be  necessary  to  have  every
           section in this region  for  successful  reconstructions.  Grids  were  stained  with  a  5  %  aqueous
           solution of uranyl acetate for 10 min at  60  øC  and  then  with  lead  citrate  for  5  min  at  room
           temperature  according  to  the  procedure  of  Reynolds  (1963).   Sections   were   photographed   on
           cut film  with  an  AEI  6B  or  an  AEI  802  electron  microscope.  Most  reconstructions  were  done
           directly from prints of micrographs of nervous tissue. In  the  region  of  the  nerve  ring,  four-way
           montages  were  necessary;  in  other  regions,  single  prints  were  sufficient.  Every  section  was
           photographed in the region  of  the  nerve  ring  and  other  areas  of  dense  neuropile:  photographs
           of every third section usually sufficed  for  following  process  bundles.  Some  use  was  made  of  a
           computer-aided  reconstruction  system  described  by  White  (1974)  and  Stevens  &   White   (1979),
           but most of the reconstructions were done by hand from a total of about 8000 prints.
             Small groups  of  processes  were  given  arbitrary  labels,  which  were  written  onto  the  prints
           with Rotting drafting  pens.  These  labels  were  carried  through  all  the  pictures  in  which  the
           associated processes were  present,  and  this  procedure  was  repeated  until  all  process  profiles
           were labelled. Processes could  then  be  joined  to  other  processes  where  branches  had  occurred,
           or ultimately be assigned to particular neurons if their cell bodies  were  within  the  scope  of  the
           reconstruction.  When  all  the  labelling  was  completed,  each  process  was  individually  followed
           through every section in which it appeared, and a list  was  compiled  of  all  the  synaptic  contacts
           that it made. In this way  all  synaptic  contacts  were  recorded  twice,  once  for  each  member  of
           an interacting pair of processes. This provided a useful check  on  synapse  scoring  as  any  synaptic
           contact that was only scored once was reappraised.
             The reconstructions were  done  piecemeal  with  data  from  five  overlapping  series;  these  were
           designated  N2T,  N2U,  JSH,  N2Y  and  JSE  (figure  A  1,  Appendix  1).  The  structure  was  found
           to be sufficiently invariant for equivalent processes and cell bodies to be identified in  the  region
           of overlap of two series. The N2T series was the  first  extended  series  to  be  cut  in  the  head;
           the reconstructions of the head sensilla described by Ward et al. (1975) were based  on  this  series.
           Although this series extended through the nerve ring and  into  the  ventral  cord,  mesh  grids  were
           used and it was found that the  inevitable  occasional  section  loss,  through  obscuration  by  grid
           bars, allowed only a limited reconstruction to be done of these regions. The NgU series was

            6                                     J.G. WHITE AND OTHERS

            from   an   old   hermaphrodite   that   gave   good    quality    pictures.    It    was    sectioned    on    slot    grids
            through   the   nerve   ring   and   anterior   ventral   cord   and   a   complete    reconstruction    of    this    region
            was   obtained.   This   series   also   covered   more   than    half    the    body    length    of    the    animal    and
            enabled   the   anterior   ventral   and   dorsal   cords   to   be   reconstructed.   The   JSH   animal   was   a    fourth
            stage   (L4)   larva,   which   was   sectioned   on   slot   grids.   A   complete    reconstruction    of    the    nervous
            system   in   the   nerve   ring   and   anterior   ventral   cord   was   obtained   from   this   animal.   This    allowed
            the  structure   deduced   from   the   N2U   series   to   be   validated   in   these   regions,   which   are   the   most
            difficult   to   reconstruct   because   they   contain   dense   neuropile   with   many   processes    that    run    close
            to  the  plane   of   sectioning.   Few   significant   differences   in   structure   that   could   be   age-related   were
            seen   between   the   N2U   and   JSH   series.   The   tail   ganglia   and   some   of   the   posterior    ventral    and
            dorsal   cord   were   covered   in   the   JSE   reconstruction.    The    region    between    the    anterior    extremity
            of   the   JSE   series   and   the   posterior   extremity   of   the   N2U   series   has   not   been   reconstructed   in
            a   hermaphrodite.   A   long    series    that    overlapped    at    both    ends,    designated    N2Y,    was    obtained
            from   a   male   animal   (Sulston   et   al.   1980,   in   which   it   was   referred    to    as    series    4).    The
            motoneurons    of    the    ventral    cord    and    the    cells    from    the    posterior    lateral    ganglion    were
            reconstructed   from   this    animal.    The    motoneurons    (with    the    exception    of    the    sex-specific    VCn
            class)   exhibited   essentially   the   same   synaptic    behaviour    as    their    anterior    counterparts    in    the
            hermaphrodite.   As   there   was   also   no   reason   to   expect   any   sex-related    differences    in    the    cells
            of   the   posterior   lateral   ganglia,   these   data   were   incorporated   to   enable   a   complete    reconstruction
            of  the  whole   nervous   system   to   be   obtained.   The   structure   that   is   described   is   a   composite   that
            has been derived from all these series except JSH.

                                   Reliability of data

              The   biggest   problem   that   was   encountered   in   the   course    of    the    reconstruction    work    was    the
            location   of   errors.   Errors   were   generally   made   in   one   of   three   ways.    (1)    The    most    prevalent
            was    human    error,    which    would    occur    when    following    long    featureless     process     bundles     and
            which  typically  resulted   in   switches   in   process   labels.   (2)   Many   processes   run   close   to   the   plane
            of   sectioning   in   the   vicinity   of   the   nerve   ring,   with   the   result   that   the   membranes   of    these
            processes    would    often    be    cut    obliquely    and    give     indistinct     images.     This     made     process
            identification   very   difficult   in   such   situations,   leading   to   the   second   most    prevalent    source    of
            errors.  (3)  Similar   errors   of   process   identification   also   occurred   in   regions   of   poor   image   quality
            caused  by  dirt  on   sections   or   loss   of   sections   on   grid   bars   although,   surprisingly,   this   was   the
            least prevalent source of errors.
              Errors    generally    manifested    themselves    by    the    appearance    of    an    improbable    structure,     such
            as  a  process  that  was  joined  to  more  than   one   cell   body   or   conversely   not   joined   to   any   at   all.
            Much   of   the   nervous   system    was    found    to    be    bilaterally    symmetrical;    some    of    the    sensory
            receptors   in   the   head   have   higher    levels    of    symmetry.    Any    deviations    that    were    seen    from
            expected     symmetries     were     considered     suspect.     Errors     were     located     either     by     exhaustive
            searching  of  every  section   that   contained   the   process   that   was   in   question,   or   by   looking   at   the
            reconstructions   for   discontinuities   in   synaptic    behaviour,    and    then    closely    checking    the    regions
            of   the    process    where    the    discontinuities    occurred.    In    this    way    a    complete,    self-consistent
            structure   was   built   up.   The   structures   of   the   major   regions    of    neuropile    have    been    validated
            by   separate   reconstructions;   the   JSH   series   in   the   case   of   the   nerve   ring   and   the   Ngs    series
            in   the   case   of   the   ventral   cord   (White    et    al.    1976).    Hall    has    undertaken    an    independent
            reconstruction  of  the  tail   ganglia;   the   structure   that   he   describes   is   essentially   the   same   as   the
            structure that we describe here (Hall 1977).

                                                    THE MIND OF A WORM                                                                7

              We   are   reasonably   confident   that   the   structure   that    we    present    is    substantially    correct    and
            gives   a   reasonable   picture   of   the   organization   of   the   nervous   system   in   a    typical    C.    elegans
            hermaphrodite.  It  is  likely   that   in   the   elaboration   of   a   structure   of   this   complexity   that   a   few
            small  errors   might   have   crept   in,   but   we   feel   that   these   may   be   quite   limited   because   of   the
            amount   of   cross-checking   that   was   done.    A    few    minor    ambiguities    still    exist,    however,    which
            would require a considerable effort to clear up. These are described in Appendix 2.

                                     Nomenclature

              We   have   adopted    a    uniform    system    of    nomenclature    for    naming    the    neurons    and    associated
            cells   of   C.   elegans:   Unfortunately   it   was   not   practicable   to   make   such   a   system   compatible    with
            the   various   nomenclatures   that   have   been   used   up   till   now.    Appendix    3    lists    the    equivalences
            between these systems and the one used in this study.
              Neurons   are   given   arbitrary   names   consisting   of   three   upper   case   letters.   The   last    letter    can
            alternatively   be   a   number   of   up   to   two   digits.    Additional    symmetry    descriptors    are    added    to
            the  name  in  the  cases  of  groups   of   cells   that   are   in   the   same   class   and   related   to   each   other
            by   simple   geometric   symmetries.   These   descriptors   are   D   or   V    (dorsal    or    ventral)    and    L    or
            R  (left   or   right).   A   group   of   cells   with   six-fold   symmetry,   such   as   IL1,   has   as   its   members:
            IL1DL,    IL1DR,    IL1L,    IL1R,    IL1VL    and     IL1VR.     The     members     of     the     classes     of motoneuron
            in   the   ventral   cord   do   not   have   these   symmetrical   relations   with   each   other.    In    these    cases,
            the  third  digit  of  the  class  name   is   a   numeral,   which   represents   the   anterior   or   posterior   location
            of   the   neuron   relative   to    its    fellow    class    members;    for    example,    VA3    is    the    third    VA
            motoneuron.   The   use   of   the   three-letter    name    without    descriptors    implies    all    members    of    the
            class  if  there  is  more  than  one.  For  the   motoneurons,   a   lower   case   n   is   used   in   the   third   digit
            position to represent the generic name for all class members (for example, VAn).
              A  slight  modification  of  this  system  is  used  to   describe   the   associated   cells   of   sensilla,   i.e.   the
            sheath  and  socket  cells.  A  sheath  cell  is   designated   by   'sh'   and   a   socket   cell   'sa'.   Thus   in   the
            case   of   the   right   sub-dorsal   cephalic   sensillum,   the   neuron   is   referred   to   as   CEPDR,   the   sheath
            cell as CEPshDR and the socket cell as CEPsoDR.

                           GENERAL          DESCRIPTION          OF          C.          ELEGANS

              C.  elegans  is  a  small,  free-living,  soil   nematode   worm.   It   has   a   generation   time   of   about   3.5   d
            and  grows  to  a  length  of  1.3  mm  and  a  diameter  of  80  [tm   if   there   is   a   plentiful   supply   of   food.
            It   is   a   self-fertilizing   hermaphrodite,   one   animal   generally   giving   rise   to    about    300    offspring.
            Occasionally,  at  a  frequency   of   about   1   in   10a,   a   male   is   produced,   which   is   capable   of   mating
            with   the   hermaphrodites.   C.   elegans   can   easily   be   cultured   in   the   laboratory   on    bacterial    lawns
            grown   on   an   agar   substrate.   Mutations   may   be   readily   produced   by    a    variety    of    mutagens    and
            will    segregate    out    as    homozygous    clones    without    having     to     set     up     back-crosses.     These
            characteristics   make   the    animal    very    amenable    to    genetic    analyses,    and    many    behavioural    and
            morphological mutants have been mapped (Brenner x974; Swanson et al. 1984).

                                      Behaviour

              The   animals   pass   through   four   larval   stages   before   reaching    adulthood'    L1,    L2,    L3    and    L4.
            Each   stage   is   terminated   by   a   moult.   If   food   is   scarce,   animals   can   go   through   an   alternative
            developmental   sequence   in   which   a   resistant   'dauer'   larval   form   is   produced   at    the    L2    to    L3
            moult. Dauers can survive extreme conditions (desiccation and lack of food) for long periods

            8                                     J.G. WHITE AND OTHERS

            until   conditions    improve    and    food    becomes    available,    at    which    time    they    will    moult    and
            become   normal   adults   (Cassada   &   Russell   1975;   Riddle   et   al.   1981   ).   Several    structural    changes
            occur  on   entering   the   dauer   stage,   including   alterations   to   the   endings   of   some   sensory   receptors
            (Albert & Riddle 1983).
              C.    elegans    normally    inhabits    the    interstices    between    damp    soil    particles    or    in     rotting
            vegetation.  It  lives  in  a  film  of  water  and  is   held   to   solid   surfaces   by   surface   tension.   Locomotion
            is    achieved    by    dorso-ventral    flexures    of    the    body,    which    give    rise    to    sinusoidal     wave
            propagation   along   the   length    of    the    body.    This    can    either    be    in    the    anterior-to-posterior
            direction,    giving    rise    to    forward    motion,    or    in    the    posterior-to-anterior    direction,     giving
            backward  motion.  The   head   has   an   extra   degree   of   freedom,   in   that   it   can   make   lateral   as   well
            as     dorso-ventral     movements.     The     dorso-ventral     flexures     (with     the     consequential     sinusoidal
            posture   of   the   body),   combined   with   the   surface   tension   forces,   constrain   the   animals   to   lie   on
            their  sides.  The  L1,   dauer   and   adult   stages   have   longitudinal   lateral   ridges   of   cuticle,   the   alae,
            which   may   act   to   increase   lateral   friction   and   minimize   sideslip.    The    thickness    of    the    water
            film  is  quite  critical;  too   thin   or   no   water   film   results   in   the   animals'   becoming   desiccated   and
            dying,  whereas  if  the  film   is   greater   than   their   diameter   they   are   not   held   down   to   the   surface
            and  are   unable   to   make   any   progress.   C.   elegans   can   move   well   on   an   agar   surface   even   though
            this  must  be  quite  different  from  its  normal  habitat.   If   there   is   no   food   available   locally   it   will
            move   forward   for   quite   long   periods   with   occasional    short    intermissions    of    reversing.    When    it
            locates   food   it   starts   eating   and   stops   moving,   except   for   short   foraging   excursions   forwards   and
            backwards. Eggs tend to be laid only when the hermaphrodites have a plentiful food supply.
              C.   elegans   responds   in   a   regulated   manner   to   a   number   of   sensory   stimuli:   it    will    chemotax
            up a gradient of chemical attractant or down a gradient of repellant (Ward 1973; Dusenbery
            1974);   it   will   avoid   regions   of   high   osmolarity    (Culotti    &    Russell    1978);    it    will    actively
            maintain itself at an optimum temperature in a temperature gradient (Hedgecock & Russell
            1975)  and   it   will   respond   to   light   touch   by   moving   away   from   the   point   of   stimulation   (Chalfie
            &   Sulston   1981).   In   addition   to   these    responses,    the    worm    presumably    uses    its    mechanosensory
            system    to    navigate    through    the    interstices    between    soil    particles    in    its    natural    habitat.
            Mating-specific   behaviour   is   exhibited    only    by    the    male    (Hodgkin    1983),    which    has    additional
            neural circuitry in the tail for controlling copulation (Sulston et al. 1980).

                                      Structure

              The   animal   is   ensheathed   in   a   tough   impermeable   elastic   cuticle,   which    is    laid    down    by    a
            system    of    underlying    hypodermal    cells.    The    body    cavity     (the     pseudocoelome)     is     maintained
            at  a  high  hydrostatic  pressure  relative   to   the   outside;   it   is   this   pressure,   acting   on   the   elastic
            cuticle, which gives the animal its rigidity (the so-called hydrostatic skeleton (Crofton 1966)).
              There   are   four   longitudinal   ridges   running   down   the   inside    of    the    body    cavity:    two    medial
            and   two   lateral.   These   ridges   consist   of   a   ridge   of   hypodermis   adjacent   to   a   bundle   of    nerve
            processes,   the   whole   structure   being   bounded    by    a    basal    lamina.    Body    movements    are    mediated
            by   four   strips   of   muscle   cells    running    in    four    quadrants    between    these    longitudinal    ridges.
            Muscle   cells   have   no   obvious    attachment    points    at    either    end    and    probably    have    attachments
            to   the   hypodermis   distributed   along   their   length.    They    act    to    deform    the    cuticle    elastically
            against the stress produced by the turgor pressure.
              Food   is   pumped   into   the   animal   and   processed   by   a   prominent    pharynx.    This    is    a    virtually
            self-contained   organ    with    its    own    musculature,    epithelium    and    nervous    system,    and    has    been
            described in detail by Albertson & Thomson (1976). The pharynx probably functions as a

           largely   autonomous    unit,    although    there    are    two    interneurons    that    originate    in    the    central
           nervous   system   and   enter   it.   These    interneurons    (RIP)    are    exclusively    postsynaptic    outside    the
           pharnyx   and   so   probably   mediate    the    overall    control    of    pharyngeal    pumping    from    the    central
           nervous   system.   The   pharynx   is   used   for   ingesting   food    (usually    bacteria),    concentrating    it    by
           filtration   and   then   grinding   it,   and   probably   also   for   secreting   digestive   enzymes   from   its   gland
           cells   (Albertson   &    Thomson    1976).    The    processed    food    is    pumped    into    the    intestine,    which
           has   a   lumen   lined   with   microvilli.   The   intestine    is    connected    with    the    anus;    defecation    is
           controlled by three sets of specialized muscles (figure 12).
             There   is   an   excretory   system,   which   consists   of   a   single   excretory   canal   cell   arranged   in    an
           '  [4'  configuration  (Bird  1971  ).  The  two  arms   of   the   Iq   run   longitudinally   down   the   lateral   lines.
           These   are   joined   by   a   cross   bridge,   which   is   connected   to   the   excretory   duct   on    the    ventral
           side;   this   opens   to   the   outside   of   the   animal   via   the   excretory   pore   situated   on   the    ventral
           mid-line.   Two    ventrally    situated    'gland'    cells    have    anteriorly    directed    processes,    which    fuse
           and   connect   to   the   lumen   of   the   excretory   canal   near   the   pore   (Nelson    et    al.    1983).    These
           processes   continue   running   anteriorly   on   the   ventral   surface   of    the    ventral    nerve    cord    (figure
           16)  until   the   nerve   ring   is   reached,   where   they   terminate.   The   function   of   these   glands   is   not
           yet known.
             The     adult     hermaphrodite     reproductive     system     consists     of     symmetrical     pairs     of     uteri,
           oviducts,   spermathecae   and   ovaries,   which   are   joined   at   the   uteri   and   connect   to   a   vulva.    This
           is   situated   on   the   ventral   mid-line   about   halfway   down   the   body   (Hirsh    et    al.    x976).    During
           development,   sperm   are   produced    before    oocytes    and    are    stored    for    subsequent    use.    Egg-laying
           is  mediated  by  a  set  of  sixteen   muscle   cells,   eight   of   which   act   to   squeeze   the   contents   of   the
           uteri and eight to open the vulval orifice (figure 11).
             The  male   gonad   joins   the   rectum   via   the   vas   deferens   to   form   a   cloaca   in   the   tail   (Sulston
           et   al.   1980).   The   cloaca   is   surrounded   by   a   large,   fan-like,   copulatory   bursa,   which   is    richly
           endowed    with    sensory    endings.    These    endings    are    derived    from     male-specific     neurons,     which
           are   generated   post-embryonically    along    with    other    neurons    in    the    male.    The    male    also    has
           extra   ventral   body   muscles   and   muscles    that    control    the    copulatory    spicules    (Sulston    et    al.
           1980).

                                THE           NERVOUS           SYSTEM

                          Organization of  the  nervous  system  and  musculature

             There   are   302   neurons   in   the   nervous   system   of   C,i   elegans;   this   number   is   invariant    between
           animals.   Each   neuron   has   a    unique    combination    of    properties,    such    as    morphology,    connectivity
           and   position,   so   that   every   neuron   may   be   given   a   unique   label.   Groups   of   neurons   that   differ
           from  each  other   only   in   position   have   been   assigned   to   classes.   There   are   118   classes   that   have
           been  made  using  these  criteria,  the  class  sizes   ranging   from   1   to   13.   Thus   C.   elegans   has   a   rich
           variety   of   neuron   types   in   spite   of   having   only   a   small   total   complement   of   neurons.   This    is
           in   marked   contrast   to   structures   such    as    the    mammalian    cerebellum,    which    contains    more    than
           10lø   neurons   (Braitenberg   &   Atwood   1958)   and   yet    has    only    five    classes    of    component    neuron
           (Eccles et al. 1967).

           Sensory transduction

             The  bulk  of  the  nervous   system   of   C.   elegans   is   situated   in   the   head,   which   is   richly   endowed
           with   sensory   receptors.   These   are   arranged   in   groups   of   sense    organs,    known    as    sensilla.    The
           arrangement and structure of sensilla have been described in detail (Ward et al. 1975; Ware

             10                              J.G. WHITE AND OTHERS

            et al. 1975; Wright 1980).  Each  sensillum  contains  one  or  a  number  of  ciliated  nerve  endings
            and two non-neuronal cells' a sheath  cell  and  a  socket  cell.  A  socket  cell  is  effectively  an
            interfacial hypodermal cell acting to join the  sensillum  to  the  hypodermis.  A  sheath  cell  is  a
            glial-like cell that envelops the endings of  neurons.  Its  inner  surface,  adjacent  to  the  neural
            dendrite, is extensively invaginated and large number of  secretory-like  vesicles  are  often  present
            in the cytoplasm. The sheath cells  of  the  cephalic  sensilla  have,  in  addition,  fiat  sheet-like
            processes that partly envelop the neuropile of the  nerve  ring  and  the  anterior  extremity  of  the
            ventral cord (figure 16). The function of  sheath  cells  is  not  known,  but  they  probably  act  to
            establish a defined extracellular milieu for the receptor endings.
              Two large  sensilla,  the  amphids,  are  located  laterally  and  have  internal  channels,  formed
            by the sheath and socket cells,  which  open  through  the  cuticle  to  the  outside.  Eight  neurons
            have their ciliated endings in this channel; a further four  are  associated  with  the  sheath  cell.
            There are two analogous structures, the phasmids, in the tail, but  they  are  simpler  in  that  they
            only  have  two  neurons  ending  in  the  channel.   The   amphids   and   phasmids   are   generally
            considered to be the main chemoreceptive  organs  in  the  animal,  because  their  structure  permits
            a group of nerve endings to be exposed to the external environment of the animal.
              The  other  sensilla  in  the  head  are  arranged  into  two  concentric  rings  around  the   mouth
            (figure 1). There is an inner  ring  of  six,  the  inner  labial  sensilla,  each  of  which  has  two
            associated neurones (II1 & IL2). The  dendrites  of  IL2  penetrate  the  cuticle  to  the  outside  of
            the  animal  and  so  they  could  be  chemoreceptors.  The  other  ending  (IL1)  lies   embedded   in
            the cuticle. There is an outer ring of four sensilla, the quadrant  outer  labials  (OLQ.),  and  these
            are paired with another set of  four,  the  cephalic  sensilla  (CEP).  Two  additional  lateral  outer
            labial sensilla (OLL) are situated next to  the  amphid  channel  openings.  The  only  other  sensilla
            in the hermaphrodite are two pairs  of  lateral  sensilla,  the  deirids,  situated  laterally  in  the
            anterior  body  (ADE)  and  the  posterior  body  (PDE).  These  sensilla  have  similar   morphologies
            to the cephalic sensilla in the head (Ward et al. 1975).
              In addition to the neurons of the sensilla  there  are  other  classes  of  neuron,  which,  on  the
            basis  of  their  connectivity  and  morphology,  also   probably   serve   a   sensory   transduction
            function.  The  best  characterized  neurons  of  this  type  are  the  touch  receptors   ALM,   PLM,
            AVM and PVM. These have specialized, microtubule-filled processes, which run in close
            apposition to the hypodermis (Chalfie & Sulston 1981).

            Disposition of cell bodies and ganglia

            Several  ganglia  have  been  described  and  named  in  the  nervous  systems  of   other   nematodes
            (Chitwood  &  Chitwood  1974).  We  have  retained   these   names,   where   appropriate,   for   the
            ganglia in C. elegans. In several regions,  cells  are  grouped  together  into  well-defined  ganglia
            by  the  arrangement  of  the  basal  lamina  in  the  pseudocoelome.  This   sometimes   results   in
            adjacent cells' being partitioned into different ganglia. The lateral  and  ventral  ganglia  are  not
            obviously separated in figure 2, for example, but in fact  the  cells  of  the  ventral  ganglion  are
            a well-defined group (figure 3), being separated  from  those  of  the  adjacent  lateral  ganglia  by
            two basal laminae  (figure  13).  The  arrangement  of  the  basal  lamina  around  the  pseudocoelome
            will be discussed later; we will now describe the disposition of the various ganglia.
              Most of the neurons of  C.  elegans  have  their  cell  bodies  situated  in  the  head  around  the
            pharynx  (figure  2).  The  pharynx  is  composed  of  two  prominent  bulbs  joined  by  an  isthmus.
            An extensive region of neuropile, the circumpharyngeal nerve ring, encircles the centre region

           FIGURE 1. Sensory receptors in the head, as seen in an idealized section near the tip of the head. This region is richly
              endowed with sensory  receptors,  which  are  organized  in  a  precise,  complex  arrangement.  Most  of  the  receptors
              are components of sensilla,  and  have  associated  sheath  and  socket  cells.  The  amphid  sensilla  are  situated  in
              the lateral labia  and  have  channels  that  are  open  to  the  outside  with  ADL,  ADF,  ASG,  ASH,  ASE,  ASI,  AS,]
              and  ASK  entering  them.  AWA,  AWB,  AWC   and   AFD   are   associated   with   the   amphid   sheath   cells.   There
              is a single inner labial sensillum in each  labium,  containing  IL1  and  IL2  receptor  neurons.  These  sensilla  also
              have channels to the outside, through  which  the  processes  of  IL2  project.  The  two  dorsal  and  the  two  ventral
              labia each have a single cephalic  sensillum  with  a  CEP  receptor,  and  a  single  outer  labial  sensillum  with  an
              OLO receptor. The lateral  labia  also  each  have  an  outer  labial  sensillum  but  with  an  OLL  receptor.  FLP  and
              BAG are ciliated receptors that  are  free  inside  the  head  and  are  not  part  of  a  sensillum.  URX  and  URY  are
              not ciliated but have specialized flattened endings, which  insinuate  themselves  around  the  inner  and  outer  labial
              sensilla.

           of  the  isthmus  and   has   cell   bodies   clustered   adjacent   to   it   both   anteriorly   and   posteriorly.   There
           are   no   obvious   subgroupings   of   the   neuron   cell   bodies   anterior   to   the   ring   and   so   these    have
           been   lumped   together   and   referred   to   as   the   anterior   ganglion.   The   anterior    ganglion    is    mainly
           made  up  of  the  cell   bodies   of   neurons,   sheath   cells   and   socket   cells   from   the   sensilla   that   are
           located  in  the  six  labia  of  the  head  (figure  1).  The   relative   positions   of   cell   bodies   within   ganglia
           are    fairly    well    conserved    between    animals    of    the    same    developmental    stage     and     genotype.
           There  is  a   certain   amount   of   'slop',   however;   the   extent   of   this   can   be   seen   by   comparing   the
           .left  and  right  sides  illustrated  in  figure   2.   The   most   extreme   cases   of   variability   in   this   region
           arise  because  the  anterior  bulb  of   the   pharynx   fits   fairly   tightly   in   the   body   cavity   and   excludes
           cell   bodies   from   its   region   of   maximum   diameter.   This   leads   to   some   uncertainty   in   the   position
           of   some   cell   bodies   with   respect   to   the   bulb;   for   example,   in   the   NgU    reconstruction,    OLQsoDL
           lies   anterior   to   the   bulb,   whereas   its   symmetrical   partner,   OLOsoDR,   lies   posterior   to    the    bulb
           (figure  2).  In  live  animals,  cells  can  sometimes  be  seen  to   flip   from   one   side   of   the   anterior   bulb
           to the other as the pharynx moves.

           Posterior  to   the   nerve   ring,   the   basal   laminae   split   the   cell   bodies   adjacent   to   the   ring   into
           four   groups   (figure   13):   a   small   dorsal   ganglion,   two   lateral   ganglia,    and    a    ventral    ganglion
           (figure   3).   All   receptor   neurons   of   the   amphid   sensilla   have   their   cell   bodies   in    the    lateral
           ganglia,   which   also   contain    cell    bodies    of    motoneurons    and    interneurons.    The    dorsal    ganglion
           contains   interneurons   together   with   the   neurons   of   the   two   dorsal   cephalic    sensilla.    The    ventral
           ganglion   contains   interneurons    and    motoneurons.    The    cell    bodies    of    the    ventral    ganglion    are
           separated  into  two  groups   (figure   3)   by   a   mechanical   intrusion,   as   are   the   cells   of   the   anterior
           ganglion. In this case it is the excretory duct and canal that displaces the cells.

           FIGURE 3. View of the ventral gang]ion. The ceils of the ventral ganglion are bounded by a basal lamina, which
             separates them from cells of the lateral ganglia even though  they  are  adjacent  (figure  2).  The  posterior  region
             of the ganglion is interrupted by the presence  of  the  excretory  duct  and  excretory  canal  cells,  which  exclude
             the cell bodies of  neurons  from  this  region.  VB2,  AVFR  and  SABVL  are  part  of  the  retro-vesicular  ganglion
             and are separated from the cells of the ventral ganglion by a basal lamina. All  the  cells  of  the  ventral  ganglion
             project into the nerve ring, and several of the cell classes present also have members in the lateral ganglia.

             The   posterior   extremities   of   the   ventral    ganglion    overlap    the    anterior    of    the    retrovesicular
           ganglion,   which   is   situated   on   the   ventral   mid-line   posterior   to   the   excretory   pore    (figure    2);
           however,   the   two   groups   of   cells   are   distinct,   being   separated   by   basal   laminae.   A    single    row
           of  cell  bodies   runs   down   the   ventral   mid-line   (figure   4)   from   the   retro-vesicular   ganglion   to   the
           tail,   where   it   ends   in   another   ganglion,   the   pre-anal   ganglion.   There    are    three    extra    ganglia
           in   the   tail:   two   laterally   symmetric   lumbar   ganglia    and    a    single,    small    dorso-rectal    ganglion
           (figure  5).  There  is  a   pair   of   small   lateral   ganglia   in   the   posterior   body,   the   posterior   lateral
           ganglia, and there are some isolated cells along the body laterally (figure 4).
             The anterior ganglion, the ventral ganglion and the dorso-rectal ganglion are completely

           FIGURE 2. The locations of the cell bodies of all the neurons and their associated cells in the head is shown in left-hand
              (a) and right-hand (b) views. Cells marked  with  an  asterisk  are  on  or  near  the  centre  line  and  are  shown  in
              both  views.  These  diagrams  were  derived  from  reconstructions  of  electron  micrographs   of   one   animal   and,
              because of the difficulty of  accurately  measuring  section  thickness,  there  may  be  some  longitudinal  distortion.
              This is not excessive, however, as the  overall  longitudinal  scale  was  normalized  to  views  taken  from  the  light
              microscope. The anterior bulb of  the  pharynx  fits  tightly  in  the  body  hypodermis  and  excludes  cell  bodies  in
              the region of its maximum diameter. Cell bodies that  are  in  this  region  are  sometimes  indeterminate  as  to  which

          FIGURE 4:. The locations of the cell bodies of all the neurons and their associated cells in the body are shown on
             the  left-hand  side  (a),   the   right-hand   side   (b)   and   the   middle   (c).   These   diagrams   were   derived   from   light
             microscope   observations   (Sulston   &   Horvitz   1977).   The    asymmetries    in    the    positions    of    SDQL/R,    AVM    and
             PVM  are  a  consequence  of  the   different   migration   patterns   of   the   initially   bilaterally   symmetric   precursor   cells
             QL  and   QR.   The   ventral   cord   motoneurons   shown   in   (c)   can   be   separated   into   those   that   are   present   at
             hatching,  shown  by  the  labels  on   the   right,   and   those   that   develop   postembryonically,   shown   by   the   labels   on
             the  left.  The  anterior-posterior  sequence  of  cell  types  in  these  two  groups  is  always  the   same,   but   there   is   some
             slight variation in the way the two groups intercalate, giving some variation in the combined adult sequence.

            lumbar   ganglia.    Thus    the    body    has    three    main    compartments    where    neuron    cell    bodies    are
            located, two lateral and one ventral.
              There   seem   to   be   no   functional   correlates   to   the   groupings   of   cells   into    particular    ganglia.
            Often   cells   are   more   analogous,   in   structure   and   connectivity,   to   cells   in    other    ganglia    than
            to  cells  in   the   same   ganglia.   Ganglia   simply   seem   to   be   local   groupings   of   cell   bodies   brought
            about by extraneous mechanical factors.

            Disposition of process tracts

              The  nervous  system  of C.   elegans   is   made   up   of   a   set   of   interconnected   parallel   process   bundles.
            These   run   either   longitudinally    or    circumferentially,    adjacent    to    hypodermal    tissue    (figures    6
            and  7).  The  two   sub-dorsal   and   the   two   sub-ventral   labia   at   the   tip   of   the   head   each   have   a
            single   process   bundle   associated   with   them.   This   is   made   up   of   processes   from   the   sensilla    in
            the   labium,    together    with    other    processes    that    terminate    near    the    sensilla    but    have    no
            differentiated   endings.   The   lateral   labia   have    similar    process    bundles    but,    in    addition,    each
            has   a   larger   process   bundle   made   up   of   processes   of   the   neurons   of   the   amphid   sensilla.   Most
            of  the   processes   in   the   six   non-amphidial   bundles   have   associated   cell   bodies,   which   are   situated
            in   front   of   the   nerve   ring   in   the   anterior   ganglion.   Individual   processes   peel   away    from    the
            bundle   to   join   their   (bipolar)   cell   bodies.   A   second,   posteriorly   directed   process    emanates    from
            the cell body and rejoins the process bundle, running in the same region of the bundle as its
                anteriorly directed counterpart. The six labial process bundles run posteriorly past the outside
            of the nerve ring and then turn to enter the nerve ring near its posterior face (figure 6). The
            processes   in   the   amphid   bundle   bypass   the    ring    completely    and    run    to    their    (bipolar)    cell
            bodies,   situated   in   the   lateral   ganglia.   Axonal    processes    from    these    cell    bodies,    along    with
            processes   from    monopolar    cell    bodies    of    interneurons    and    motoneurons,    enter    the    nerve    ring
            via  two  main  routes.   Cells   in   the   ventral   region   of   the   lateral   ganglia   have   processes   that   join
            the    amphidial    commissures;    these    run    circumferentially    round    the    animal,    between    muscle     and
            hypodermis,   to   the   ventral   mid-line,   where   they   turn   and   enter   the   nerve    ring.    Cells    in    the
            dorsal   regions   of   the   lateral   ganglia   do   not   take   this   somewhat   circuitous   route   but   enter    the
            nerve ring directly sub-dorsally.
              The   circumpharyngeal   nerve   ring    is    the    most    extensive    region    of    neuropile    in    the    animal
            and  consists   of   a   large   toroidal   bundle   of   processes,   most   of   which   have   entered   the   ring   from
            the  process   tracts   described   above.   The   processes   in   the   nerve   ring   are   derived   from   the   sensory
            receptors    in    the    head,     interneurons,     and     motoneurons     that     innervate     head     muscles     via
            neuromuscular   junctions   (NMJs)   situated   on   the   inside   surface   of   the   ring.    The    cell    bodies    of
            both the interneurons and the motoneurons are situated in the lateral and ventral ganglia.
              A   large   process   bundle,   the   ventral   nerve   cord   (figures   6-8   and   18),   runs   along    the    ventral
            mid-line   extending   from   the   ventral   region   of   the   nerve   ring.   The   cord   enlarges   in   this    region
            because   additional   processes   are   joining   it   from   the   amphid    and    deirid    commissures    (figure    6).
            The  excretory  duct  splits  the  process   bundle   of   the   cord   into   two   nearly   equal   parts   as   it   opens
            to   the   outside   of   the   posterior   end   of   the   ventral   ganglion.   A   single   line   of   motoneuron   cell
            bodies   is   situated   along   the   ventral   mid-line   (figure   4),   closely   apposed   to   the    process    bundle
            (figure    18).    These    motoneurons    innervate    body    muscles;    some    innervate     ventral     muscles     and
            others   innervate   dorsal   muscles.   This   latter   class   send   processes    round    to    the    dorsal    mid-line
            via   commissures   (figure   7).   These   then   turn   either   anteriorly    or    posteriorly    and    together    make
            up another process bundle on the dorsal mid-line, the dorsal cord (figures 7 and 19). The dorsal

                                                   THE MIND OF A WORM                                                              19

           cord   is   predominantly   made   up   of   these   motoneuron   axons    but,    in    addition,    has    two    processes
           (from  ALA  and  RID),  which   originate   in   the   nerve   ring   and   enter   the   dorsal   cord   at   its   anterior
           extremity   (figure   0).   The   nerve   ring   and   the   ventral   and   dorsal    cords    are    the    only    process
           bundles   in   which   there   are   significant   numbers   of    synaptic    connections.    The    other    distinguishing
           feature   of   these   process   bundles   is   that   they   all   run   adjacent   to   ridges   of   hypodermis   (figures
           13,   18   and   19).   Because   the   hypodermal   ridge   is   situated   on   the   left   of   the    process    bundle,
           it  may  present   a   barrier   on   that   side   to   commissures   leaving   the   cord.   This   may   be   the   reason
           why most of the commissures run round the right-hand side of the animal.
             In    the    anterior    body    there    are    four    sub-laterally    situated     process     bundles     that     run
           underneath   the   body   muscles   (figure   6).   They   run   in   a    straight    line    approximately    corresponding
           to  the   junction   of   the   two   rows   of   muscles   in   each   quadrant.   There   are   five   processes   in   the
           sub-lateral   cords   behind   the   nerve   ring,   and   two   in   each   of   the   cords   in   front   of   the    ring
           (figure   8).   The   processes   in   the   anterior   cords   peter   out   in   the   head;   those   in   the   posterior
           cord   move   to   a   more   lateral   position   near   the   middle   of   the   body,   where   most    of    them    end
           (figure 7).
             Three   nerve   processes   run   for   much   of   the    length    of    the    animal,    closely    associated    with
           the   excretory   canal   (CAN-a).   These   processes   run    into    the    nerve    ring    at    the    anterior    end
           (figure 6) and peter out posteriorly in the tail.
             The   only   remaining   process   bundles   in   the   body   are   those   made   by   the   lateral    touch    receptor
           neurons,    ALM    and    PLM,    and    their    associated    neurons,    ALN    and    PLN.     The     anterior     touch
           receptors,   ALM,   run   in   close    association    with    ALN    near    the    dorsal    margin    of    the    lateral
           hypodermal    ridges,    whereas    the    posterior    receptors,    PLM,    run     along     with     PLN     near     the
           ventral    margin    of    the    lateral    hypodermal    ridges.    The     processes     of     ALN     maintain     their
           dorso-lateral  location  in  the  posterior   part   of   the   body   although   they   are   not   in   close   association
           with ALM in this region.

           Musculature

             Nematode    body    muscles    are    unusual    in    that    their    sarcomeres    have    an    oblique    conformation
           with  the  actomyosin  filaments,  aligned  at  an   angle   of   about   10c   to   the   Z   lines,   rather   than   being
           orthogonal   to   them.   This   type   of   arrangement   has   been   referred   to   as    obliquely    striated    muscle
           (Rosenbluth   1965;   Waterston   et   al.   1980).   The   Z   lines    consist    of    longitudinally    oriented    lines
           of    discrete    structures    (dense    bodies),    which    are    darkly     staining     in     electron     micrographs
           (figure 18). These structures are roughly conical in shape; the base of the cone is adjacent to

           FIGURE 7. Left-hand (a) and right-hand (b) process tracts in the body. The main process tracts are the ventral cord,
              the dorsal cord, the excretory canal  associated  processes  and  the  posteriorly  directed  sub-lateral  processes.  The
              ventral cord consists of processes  of  interneurons  and  processes  and  cell  bodies  of  motoneurons  (figures  4  and
              18). The ventral  cord  bifurcates  at  the  anus  and  runs  up  to  the  lumbar  ganglia  via  the  lumbar  commissures.
              The dorsal  cord  (figure  19)  is  predominantly  made  up  of motoneuron  processes  that  have  come  from  the  ventral
              cord via circumferential commissures, which are  distributed  along  the  length  of  the  body.  Most  of  the  processes
              in the posterior sub-lateral cords are derived from  the  nerve  ring.  These  process  bundles  run  sub-laterally  under
              the body muscles (figure 8) anteriorly,  but  move  laterally  to  each  side  of  the  lateral  hypodermal  ridges  where
              most of the processes  end.  Processes  from  SDQ  and  PLN  run  into  these  cords  from  the  opposite  direction  from
              laterally situated cell bodies. The  processes  of  CAN,  ALA,  PVD  and  also  (in  the  anterior  of  the  animal)  BDU,
              run together alongside the  excretory  cell  for  most  of  its  length.  The  anterior  touch  receptors,  ALM,  together
              with their associated neurons, ALN, run  anteriorly  near  the  dorsal  side  of  the  lateral  hypodermal  ridges;  their
              posterior counterparts, PLM and PLN, run anteriorly near the ventral side of the ridges.

                                                                2-2

            FIGURE. 8. Most of the sub-lateral processes originate from the nerve ring and run longitudinally underneath the
               muscle  quadrants  close  to  the  line  of  apposition  of  the  two   muscle   rows.   Apart   from   a   single   NMJ,   no   synapses
               have  been  seen  on  these  processes.  There  are  two  processes  in  each  of  the   sub-lateral   cords   anterior   to   the   ring
               (a)  and  five  in  each  of  the  cords  posterior  to  the  ring  (b).  The  individual  processes  run  in  fixed   positions   within
               the  cords.   The   posterior   cords   include   processes   from   PLN   and   SDQ,   which   must   have   grown   in   the   opposite
               direction  to  the  others,  as  their  cell  bodies  are  situated  laterally  in  the  body  (figure  7).  Apart  from  the   processes
               of these cells, the sublateral processes eventually peter out (figures 6 and 7).

                                                   THE MIND OF A WORM                                                              21

           the   cell   membrane,    which    is    in    turn    adjacent    to    the    hypodermis    and    cuticle.    The    body
           muscles    probably    have    attachments    to    the    elastic    cuticle    distributed     along     their     length,
           since no specialized focal attachment points are seen at the end of these muscle cells.
             Body   muscles   are   rhomboid-shaped   and    are    arranged    as    two    parallel    rows    in    each    quadrant
           (figure  10).  There   are   95   muscle   cells   in   the   adult;   the   left   ventral   quadrant   contains   23   and
           the   other   quadrants   each   contain   24:   (Sulston   &   Horvitz   1977).   The   muscles    in    the    body    can
           be  divided  up  into  three  groups  on  the  basis   of   their   source   of   synaptic   input:   the   anterior   group
           of   four   muscles   in   each   quadrant,   innervated   by   motoneurons   in   the   nerve   ring,   the   next    group
           of   four,   which   is   dually   innervated   by   motoneurons   in   the   nerve   ring    and    ventral    cord,    and
           the   remaining   muscles,   which   are    innervated    solely    by    the    motoneurons    of    the    ventral    cord
           (figure 10; see also Ware et al. (1975)).
             Motoneurons   of   the   ventral   cord   innervate    either    both    dorsal    or    both    ventral    quadrants    of
           muscle.    The    body    can    therefore    only    propagate    dorso-ventral     waves     during     locomotion.     The
           head,   on   the   other   hand,   can   make   lateral   as   well   as   dorso-ventral   movements    when    the    animal
           is   foraging.   This   is   probably   because   the   motoneurons   in   the   nerve   ring    do    not    synapse    onto
           two   quadrants   of   muscles,   but   instead   are   restricted   to   two   adjacent    rows    (not    necessarily    in
           the   same   quadrant).   This   would    allow    differential    activation    of    muscles    in    adjacent    quadrants
           and possibly even in adjacent rows.
             Nematode   muscles   are    unusual    in    that    they    have    neuron-like    processes    that    run    from    the
           muscle   bellies   to   the   neuron   process   bundles   in   which   motoneuron    axons    reside    (figures    9    and
           18).   Neuromuscular   junctions    (NMJs)    are    made    by    axons    running    along    the    surface    of    their
           process   bundle,   through   the   bounding   basal   lamina   of    the    bundle    and    onto    muscle    arms    (see,
           for    example,    VDn-a).    Muscle    arms    interdigitate    extensively    and     crowd     round     regions     where
           NMJs   occur;   there   are   often   gap    junctions    between    the    arms    in    these    regions.    Muscle    arms
           in   the   body   converge   at   the   dorsal   and   ventral   mid-lines,   where   they   interdigitate,    and    contact
           the   dorsal   and   ventral   cords   (figure    9).    Arms    from    the    head    muscles,    which    receive    their
           innervation   from   motoneurons   in   the   nerve   ring,   run   down   past    the    outside    of    the    ring    and
           then  turn   and   run   anteriorly,   closely   apposed   to   the   inner   surface   of   the   ring.   Here   they   sort
           out  in  such  a  way   that   arms   from   each   muscle   row   make   an   arc   of   about   45ø   (figure   15).   Thus
           there  is  a  mapping   by   the   muscle   arms   of   the   spatial   organization   of   the   muscle   cells   onto   the
           inner   surface   of   the   nerve   ring.   Motoneuron   axons   run   adjacent   to   the    inside    surface    of    the
           ring   and   are   arranged   in   a   well-ordered   pattern   (figure   14).   The   inside   surface   of   the    muscle-
           arm   complex   in   the   region   of   the   NMJs   is   lined   by   the   thin   sheet-like   processes   of   the    GLR
           cells   (figures   14   and   15).   No   chemical   synapses   are   seen   on   these   cells,   so   they   are   probably
           not   neuronal;   however,   they   do    make    gap    junctions    to    muscle    arms    and    to    RME    motoneurons
           (figure 15).
             There   are   sixteen   sex-specific    muscles    in    the    hermaphrodite;    eight    are    associated    with    the
           uterus   and   eight   with   the   vulva   (figure   11).   Unlike   the   body   muscles,   these   muscles   have    focal
           attachment    points    at    their    ends    and     do     not     have     obliquely     oriented     sarcomeres.     The
           hermaphrodite    gonad    has    twofold    rotational    symmetry,    the    axis    of     symmetry     passing     through
           the  centre   of   the   vulva.   The   uterine   muscles   distal   to   the   vulva,   urn2,   wrap   round   the   uterus,
           whereas   the   uterine   muscles   proximal   to   the   vulva,   uml,   attach   to   the   lateral   lines.   Both    sets

           sets   of   four   vulval   muscles,   vml   and   vm2.   The   vml   muscles    are    attached    to    the    body    wall

           FIGURE 9. The body consists of a tube of hypodermal tissue made up of two cell types' the syncytial cell (SY), which
              makes up the dorsal and  ventral  hypodermis,  and  the  lateral  seam  cells  (SE),  which  are  also  syncytial  in  the
              adult  and  are  joined  to  the  syncytial  cell  by  desmosomes.  Longitudinal  ridges  of  hypodeRmis  run   down   the
              body on the lateral, dorsal  and  ventral  lines.  Process  bundles  that  make  up  the  dorsal  and  ventral  cords  run
              alongside  the  dorsal  and  ventral  hypodermal  ridges  and  are  separated  from   the   pseudocoelome   by   a   basal
              lamina. The  body  musculature  consists  of  four  quadrants  of  obliquely  striated  muscles.  Each  quadrant  consists
              of  two  closely  apposed  rows  of  muscle  cells.  The  motoneurons  that  innervate  body  muscles  have   longitudinal
              unbranched processes  which  are  confined  to  the  dorsal  and  ventral  cords.  Muscle  cells  send  out  processes  to
              the nerve cords, where motoneurons synapse onto them through the basal lamina at NMJs.

           their   proximal   ends   to   the   hypodermal   lips   of   the   vulva.   The   vm2   muscles   attach   to    the    body
           more   ventrally,    at    the    ventral    margin    of    the    muscle quadrants,    and    are    attached    at    their
           proximal   ends   to   the   opening   in   the   uterus,   which   connects   to   the   vulva.   Most   of   the   synaptic
           input   to   the   vulval   muscles   comes   from   VCn   and   HSN   neurons    and    is    directed    onto    the    vm2
           muscles   (figure   11   c).   The   other   muscles   are   either   directly   or   indirectly   connected   to   vm2   via
           gap   junctions.   The   vmlR   muscles   send   a   muscle   arm   down   to   the   ventral   cord,   where   it   receives
           a small amount of synaptic input from ventral cord motoneurons.
             Defecation   is   controlled   by   three   sets   of   muscles:    the    anal    depressor    muscle,    the    sphincter
           muscle   and   two   laterally    symmetric    intestinal    muscles    (figure    12).    The    anal    depressor    muscle
           is   a   large   H-shaped   muscle,   which   lifts   the   roof   of   the   anus   when   it   contracts.   The   sphincter
           muscle   is   a   circular   muscle   that   closes   off   the   end   of   the   gut.   The   intestinal    muscles    have
           longitudinally   oriented   filaments,   which   are   situated   in   the   ventral    regions    of    the    cells.    The
           dorsal regions flatten into thin sheets, which wrap round the posterior ventral regions of the

             micrographs. The muscles are organized as  longitudinal  strips  in  each  of  the  four  body  quadrants  (figure  9).
             Each quadrant has two adjacent rows of  muscle  cells.  The  muscles  are  obliquely  striated  and  packed  diagonally
             so that the sarcomeres are oriented longitudinally. The first two muscle cells  in  the  two  ventral  and  two  dorsal
             rows are smaller than their lateral counterparts, giving a stagger to the packing  of  the  two  rows  of  cells  in  a
             quadrant. The first four muscles in each quadrant  are  innervated  exclusively  by  motoneurons  in  the  nerve  ring.
             The second block of four muscles is  dually  innervated,  receiving  synaptic  input  from  motoneurons  in  the  nerve
             ring and the anterior ventral cord.  The  rest  of  the  muscles  in  the  body  are  exclusively  innervated  by  NMJs
             in the dorsal and ventral cords (figure 9). The  eight  muscle  rows  have  been  labelled  dorso-medial  right  (DMR),
             dorso-lateral  right  (DLR),  ventro-lateral  right  (VLR),  ventro-medial  right  (VMR),  ventro-medial  left   (VML),

           input   was   found   to   be   present   on   the   defecation   muscles,   with   only   a   single    NMJ    being    made
           by DVB.

           Basal lamina

             The   pseudocoelomic   cavity    is    lined    with    a    thin    (20    nm)    basal    lamina,    which    effectively
           separates   the   muscles   from   the   hypodermal   and   nervous    tissues.    This    lamina    has    an    anisotropic
           structure,   as   parallel   striations   with   a   spacing   of   30   nm   can   be   seen   when    it    is    sectioned
           obliquely   (White   et   al.   1976).   The   gonad   and   the   gut   are   ensheathed   by   similar    basal    laminae;
           the   pharynx   is   ensheathed   by    its    own,    rather    thicker    (4:5    nm)    basal    lamina    (Albertson    &
           Thomson   1976).   The   dorsal    and    ventral    nerve    cords,    together    with    their    respective    hypodermal
           ridges, are bounded by the pseudocoelomic basal lamina (figures 18 and 10); the lateral

               the  uterus  (a)  and  eight   to   open   the   vulva   (b).   The   distal   uterine   muscles,   um2,   form   circumferential   bands
               of  muscle  round  the  distal  regions  of   the   uterus.   The   uml   muscles   attach   to   the   lateral   hypodermis   and   wrap
               round   the   proximal   ventral   regions   of   the   uterus.   The   vml   muscles   attach   to   the   body   hypodermis   at    the
               ventro-lateral  body  muscle   margins   and   at   the   vulval   opening.   The   vm2   muscles   attach   to   the   body   hypodermis
               sub-laterally,  insinuating   themselves   between   the   body   muscles,   and   to   the   uterus   at   the   vulval   opening.   The
               vulval  and  uterine  muscles  have  gap  junctions  to  each  other,  as   shown   in   (c).   The   main   synaptic   input   is   onto
               the  vm2  muscles  and  comes  fromVCn  (*a)  and   HSN   (*a).   The   NMJs   are   dorsal   to   the   main   part   of   the   ventral
               cord   (VCn-a).   vmlR   sends   an   arm   down   into   the   ventral   cord   and   receives   single   synapses   from    VD7,    VB0
               and VA7.

            FIGURE 12. There are three muscles directly involved in defecation: the anal depressor muscle, the anal sphincter
               muscle  and  the   two   intestinal   muscles.   The   anal   depressor   muscle   is   a   large   H-shaped   cell,   which   lifts   the
               posterior  dorsal  surface  of  the  rectum  so  as  to  open   it   and   discharge   its   contents.   The   intestinal   muscles   have
               longitudinally   oriented   contractile   filaments   and   attach   to   the   body   hypodermis   at   the   ventral    muscle    margin
               and  to  the  intestine  via  several  distributed  contacts  on   its   ventral   surface.   The   intestinal   and   depressor   muscles
               send  muscle  arms  to  the  posterior  regions   of   the   pre-anal   ganglion,   where   they   receive   synaptic   input   from   DVB
               (*c).

             hypodermal     ridges     and      the      laterally      located      ganglia      are      similarly      bounded.      The      boundary
             curves smoothly, suggesting that the lamina may be under tension in these regions.
               All    the    nervous    system    is    situated    to    one    side    of    the    pseudocoelomic    basal    lamina,     with     the
             exception    of    the    cell    bodies    of    URX,    CEPD    and     GLR.     The     processes     of     URX     and     CEPD     run
             together    on    each     side     as     they     leave     the     ring     sub-dorsally.     They     are     surrounded     by,     and
             eventually    penetrate,    the    basal    lamina    in    these    regions    before     reaching     their     cell     bodies,     which
             are    situated    in    the    pseudocoelomic    cavity.    The     basal     lamina     may     also     be     penetrated     in     four
             places on the inside of the nerve ring by muscle arms (figure 14 and RIM-d). This enables

          NMJs.
            Nerve   processes   seem   to   be   constrained   to   run   alongside   the   lamina.    Processes    that    run    from
          the   ventral   to   the   dorsal   cord,   for   example,   run   round    the    animal,    travelling    underneath    the
          muscle   quadrants   instead   of   taking   a   more   direct   internal   route.   In   the   main   part   of   the   body
          cavity   the   dorsal   and   ventral   ridges   are   quite   small,   consisting   of   a   ridge   of    hypodermis    and
          an   adjacent   process   bundle   (figure   13d).   As   the   head    is    approached,    the    dorsal,    ventral    and
          lateral   ridges   enlarge   as   they   become   filled   with   the   cell   bodies    of    their    respective    ganglia
          (figure   13c).   Eventually   the   basal   laminae   bounding   the   four   ridges   meet   and   fuse    (figure    13b).
          An   internal   tract   is   now   opened   up   and   processes   course   round   it   inside    the    muscle    quadrants
          forming  the  nerve  ring.  This   organization   is   maintained   up   to   the   tip   of   the   head   with   the   four
          muscle   quadrants   running   in   tubes   of   basal   laminae   (figure    13a).    The    central    ring    of    lamina
          left  after  the  ridges  have  fused   ends   in   the   vicinity   of   the   nerve   ring.   It   appears   to   terminate
          on  the  cylinder  that  is   made   up   of   the   sheet-like   processes   of   the   GLR   cells.   This   structure   is
          situated on the inside of the nerve ring between the pharynx and the muscle arms.
            The    arrangement    of    the    basal    lamina    lining    the    pseudocoelome    suggests    that    it    may    be
          instrumental   in   the   establishment   of   the   general    topography    of    process    tracts    in    the    nervous
          system.   Processes   from   neurons   have    been    shown    to    grow    preferentially    along    ordered    fibrillar
          arrays    (Weiss    1934).    The    striated    structure    may    likewise    serve    to    guide     initial     process
          outgrowths,    thereby    establishing     the     antero-posterior     and     circumferential     system     of     process
          bundles that are a feature of the nervous system of C. elegans.

                                    Neurons
          Branching structure

            The    component    neurons    of    the    nervous    system     of     C.     elegans     have     simple,     unbranched
          morphologies.   Few   neurons    have    more    than    two    processes,    and    many    are    monopolar    with    only
          a   single   process   (see,   for   example,   AIA).   Processes   of   neurons   run    in    parallel    bundles    except
          in  the   immediate   vicinity   of   their   cell   bodies,   where   they   join   the   bundle.   This   region   is   not
          extensive,   however,   as   cell   bodies   are   generally   situated   close   to   the    bundle    into    which    they
          project.   Branching   typically   occurs   when   a   neuron   has   a    process    that    leaves    the    main    bundle
          to   run   out   as   a   commissure   (see,   for   example,   VDn),   or   at   a   discontinuity,   where    one    bundle
          joins another (as in AQR where it leaves the ventral cord and enters the nerve ring).
            Neurons    with    a    branched    structure    generally    have    very    similar    patterns    of    branching     in
          different   animals;   however,   there   are    a    few    interesting    cases    where    differences    occur    between
          animals,   or   between   sides   of   the   same   animal.   The   interneuron   RID   lies   on   the    dorsal    mid-line
          and   sends   a   process   round   the   left-hand   side   of   the   nerve   ring   in   the   N2U   animal   and    round
          the   right-hand   side   in   the   JSH   animal.   The   nerve   ring   has   a   high   degree   of   bilateral   symmetry
          and  the   process   of   RID   runs   in   a   similar   position   relative   to   the   neighbouring   processes   whether
          it runs on the left or the right.
             The   interneuron   PVN   is   the   most   highly   branched   class   of    neuron    in    C.    elegans.    The    main
           processes   of   PVN   run   up   the   ventral   cord   and   enter   the   nerve   ring    on    the    right-hand    side,
           travelling    round    it    in    an    anticlockwise    direction.    PVNL    has    an    additional     branch,     which
           separates   from   the   main   process   at   a   point   behind   the   excretory   duct.   This    branch    enters    the
           ring  on   the   left-hand   side,   travelling   round   it   in   a   clockwise   direction.   This   process   (which   is
           not present on PVNR) runs in the same region of neuropile as do the main processes of both

            FIGURE 13. The pseudocoelome in the body is bounded by a basal lamina, which covers all the hypodermal and
               nervous  tissue  (d).  The  muscles  are  in  the  pseudocoelomic  cavity.   Processes   of   neurons   do   not,   in   general,   cross
               the   basal   lamina.   Commissures   between   the   dorsal   and   ventral    cords    pass    underneath    the    muscle    quadrants
               and  do  not  enter  the  pseudocoelomic   cavity.   As   the   ring   is   approached,   the   dorsal,   ventral   and   lateral   cords
               enlarge  where  they  are  filled  with  cell  bodies  of  the   respective   ganglia   (c).   There   is   no   direct   route   between
               the  ganglia  at  this  point,  however,  and  cell  bodies  in  the   lateral   ganglia   send   processes   into   the   ventral   cord
               via  the  amphidial  commissures  (figure  6).  At  the  level  of  the  nerve  ring,  the  lobes  of  the  basal  lamina   fuse   inside
               the   muscle   quadrants   (b)   allowing   the   processes   in   the   nerve   ring   to   run   round   without   having    to    pass
               underneath  the  muscle  quadrants.  The  processes  of  the   nerve   ring,   like   those   of   the   nerve   cords,   run   alongside
               a  ridge  of  hypodermis  (a),  which  is  anterior  to  the  neuropile.  The  nerve  ring  seals   off   the   anterior   end   of   the
               pseudocoelomic  cavity   and   there   is   no   basal   lamina   bounding   the   hypodermal   and   nervous   tissue   in   the   head,
               except for that bounding the pharynx.

            PVNR  and  PVNL,  which  are  travelling  in  the  opposite  direction;   they   also   make   similar
            synaptic  contacts.  Other  examples  of  such  conservative  variation  in  branching  patterns  have
            previously  been  noted  in  the  cephalic  receptor  neurons,  CEP  (Sulston  et  al.  1975).   These
            observations suggest that, irrespective  of  branching  structure  or  even  direction  of  growth,  a
            process is capable of  locating  its  appropriate  neighbourhood  within  the  neuropile  and  forming
            its characteristic synaptic connections.

                    THE MIND OF A WORM                                                                                                    27

             A few  examples  of  non-conservative  changes  in  branching  pattern  have  been  seen.  A  fairly
           major  branch  is  missing  on  RMFR  in  the  NgU  animal  but  is  present  on   its   contralateral
           partner and is also present  on  RMFR  in  the  JSH  animal.  As  the  missing  process  has  all  the
           NMJs  made  by  this  motoneuron,  such  a  change  must  have  a  profound  effect  on  the  function
           of RMFR in this instance. It seems reasonable  to  consider  such  incidences  of  branching  failures
           as developmental errors  in  the  construction  of  the  nervous  system,  which  could  perhaps  give
           rise to non-genetically related variations in behaviour between animals.

           Branch termination

             The processes of many classes of neuron terminate at  the  point  of  contact  with  a  process  from
           a neighbouring member of the same class. There  is  usually  a  gap  junction  at  this  point  (as  in
           ASI on the dorsal mid-line), although there is one  case  where  processes  touch  and  terminate  with
           no gap junction (RIF).  There  are  also  a  few  cases  where  such  contact  terminations  can  occur
           between  heterologous  classes  (e.g.  between  processes  of  ALM  and  AVM  in   the   nerve   ring).
           The  most  striking  examples  of  contact  termination  are  exhibited  by  the  DDn   and   the   VDn
           motoneurons  of  the  ventral  cord.  There  are  six  DDns  and  thirteen  VDns   evenly   distributed
           along the length of the cord. Each of these classes has processes in both  ventral  and  dorsal  cords.
           Together,  their  processes  make  an  unbroken  line  of  non-overlapping  processes  in   each   cord
           (White et al. 1976).  This  behaviour  seems  to  be  an  intrinsic  property  of  certain  classes  of
           neuron;  other  classes  of  neuron  make  contacts  and  gap  junctions  with  members  of  their  own
           class but do not terminate at the site of initial contact  and  may  have  considerable  overlap  (see,
           for example, ASE, AIN).

           Gap junctions

             Gap  junctions  are  organelles  that  mediate  electrical  and  metabolic  coupling,  between  cells
           (Bennett 1977)- They are seen  in  C.  elegans  as  regions  where  the  membranes  from  two  adjacent
           cells  are  closely  apposed  and  appear  more  darkly  staining  than  surrounding  regions  (as   in
           VBn-c).  When  gap  junctions  are  sectioned  transversely,  a  gap  of  about  8  nm  can   be   seen
           separating the membranes. The  region  of  close  apposition  is  usually  in  the  form  of  a  plaque
           of about  350  nm  diameter.  The  membranes  at  the  junction  are  notably  flatter  than  those  of
           the  surrounding  regions.  The  gap  junctions  seen  in  C.  elegans  resemble  those  described   by
           Pappas & Waxman (1972).
             Gap  junctions  are  seen  between  muscle  cells  and  between  neurons.  Apart  from  a  couple  of
           possible  exceptions  (RMD-h  and  VCn-f),  gap  junctions  are  not  seen  between  muscle  cells  and
           neurons, probably because  there  is  usually  a  basal  lamina  separating  the  two.  The  glial-like
           cells, GLR, are  unique  in  that  they  make  gap  junctions  to  both  muscles  (GLR-c)  and  neurons
           (GLR-d).  They  do  not,  however,  make  gap  junctions  to  themselves.  The  arrangement  of   these
           gap junctions is shown in figure 15.
             Muscle  arms  from  muscles  in  the  head  have  a  striking  arrangement  of  gap  junctions  where
           they interdigitate at  the  inside  of  the  nerve  ring.  Arms  make  gap  junctions  with  arms  from
           muscle cells in adjacent quadrants  but  not  with  arms  from  muscle  cells  in  the  same  quadrant,
           even though both sets of arms are  equally  accessible  (figure  15).  Muscles  in  the  same  quadrant
           are, however, connected  by  gap  junctions,  but  the  connections  are  situated  in  the  region  of
           the muscle cell bellies, well  away  from  the  arms.  Thus  it  seems  as  though  muscle  arms,  when
           they grow  into  the  nerve  ring,  can  discriminate  between  the  arms  of  muscle  cells  that  are
           already connected to themselves via gap junctions and those that are not.

            Chemical synapses

              Chemical   synapses   in    C.    elegans    occur    en passant    between    neighbouring    parallel    processes.    The
            presynaptic   process   has   a   vesicle-filled   varicosity   and   a    specialized,    darkly    staining    region    in
            the   membrane   adjacent   to   the   point   of   contact   with   the   postsynaptic   elements   (see,    for    example,
            BAG-a).   A   considerable   variation   in    the    size    of    the    presynaptic    regions    was    found    (compare
            OLQ-a     with     PVN-a).     The     presynaptic     specializations     also     vary      in      prominence      between
            different   classes   of   synaptic   contact   in   a   way   that   does   not   necessarily   correspond   to   the   size
            or   the   number   of   vesicles   in    the    presynaptic    process.    The    extremes    of    this    variation    are
            represented    by    RIP,    on    the    one    hand,    which    has    structures    that    look     like     presynaptic
            specializations   but   with   no   associated   synaptic   vesicles    (RIP-a);    and,    on    the    other,    by    DVA,
            which   has   large    vesicle-filled    varicosities    but    rather    small    presynaptic    specializations    (DVA-b).
            There   is   also    considerable    variation    in    the    number    of    chemical    synapses    between    pairs    of
            interacting   processes.   There   are   many   cases   where   there   is   only    a    single    synapse    present.    At
            the   other   end   of   the   scale,   the   largest   number   of   synapses   seen   between   processes    is    nineteen
            (AVDL   onto   AVAR);   more   typically   it   is   around   five.    Some    of    the    single    synapses    that    are
            seen   are   small,   with   few   synaptic   vesicles   or   indistinct    presynaptic    specializations.    Synapses    of
            this  type  are  also  rather  variable,   in   that   they   are   not   present   in   some   individuals   and   therefore
            probably   not   very   significant.   On   the   other   hand,   some    single    synapses    are    large,    with    many
            vesicles   and   unambiguous   presynaptic   specializations.    These    synapses    are    seen    in    all    individuals
            and   so   are   probably   significant.   This   latter   type   of   synapse   seems   to    occur    when    the    layout
            of  the  two  interacting  processes  is  such  that  they   are   only   adjacent   for   a   limited   extent.   In   these
            cases   there   may   only   be   room   for   a   single   synapse   in   the   region   where   the   two   processes   are
            adjacent.
              Although    the    fixation    and    staining    procedures    that    were    used    are    not    optimal    for    the
            preservation   and   visualization   of   vesicle   morphology,   several    classes    of    vesicle    can    be    clearly
            distinguished.   The   most   ubiquitous   vesicles   are   spherical,   35   nm    in    diameter,    and    have    lightly
            staining   interiors   (see,   for   example,   RIA-a).    Some    classes    of    neuron,    including    most    of    the
            amphid  receptors,  have  a  second   class   of   vesicle   coexisting   with   vesicles   of   this   first   type.   These
            vesicles   are   larger   and   have   darkly   staining   cores   (as   in   ASK-a);    the    relative    proportions    of
            the  two  types  of   vesicle   varies   with   cell   class.   There   is   a   certain   amount   of   variation   in   the
            staining   properties   of   these   dark-cored   vesicles   between   classes;   the   sizes   also   vary,   ranging   from
            37   nm   (ASE)   to   53   nm   (ASK).    The    dark-cored    vesicles    seem    generally    to    be    excluded    from
            the    region    immediately    adjacent    to    the    presynaptic    specialization,    which    contains     only     the
            smaller   type   of   vesicle.   A   similar   segregation   of   vesicle   types   is   exhibited   by   DVA,   which    has
            a  large  process  in  the   nerve   ring,   filled   with   irregularly   shaped   vesicles,   but   has   small   spherical
            vesicles    next    to     presynaptic     specializations     (DVA-a).     The     neurotransmitters     that     may     be
            contained   in   the   dark-cored   vesicles   are   not    known.    Dopamine    has    been    shown    to    be    present
            in   CEP,   ADE   and   PDE   neurons   (Sulston    et    al.    1975).    Acetylcholine    is    probably    used    as    a
            neurotransmitter    by    the    ventral    cord    motoneurons    VAn,    VBn,    DAn,    DBn    and    ASn,     as     this
            transmitter   has   been   shown   to   be   used   in   the   equivalent   neurons   in   Ascaris   (Johnson   &    Stretton
            1980).   All   these   classes    of    neuron    have    uniform    populations    of    spherical,    35    nm,    synaptic
            vesicles, with no dark-cored vesicles present (see, for example, CEP-a, VAn-a).
              Chemical    synapses    in    C.    elegans    usually    have    no    visible    specializations     on     postsynaptic
            elements and consequently there is often some ambiguity as to the identities of these elements.

                   THE MIND OF A WORM                                                                                                                        29

            In   some   cases,   the   disposition   of   the   processes   is   such   that   there   clearly   can    be    only    one
            postsynaptic   element   (as   in   ASE-a).   In   many   other   cases   there   are   two   (for   example,    in    ADF-a)
            or,   more   rarely,    three    (for    example,    in    AIY-e)    postsynaptic    elements,    making    a    dyadic    or
            triadic   synapse   (Dowling   &   Boycott   1966).   It   was   difficult   to   know   in   these   cases    whether    all
            the    postsynaptic    elements    are    functional    (i.e.    have    an    appropriate    receptor)    or    are     just
            neighbouring   processes.    It    seems    likely    that,    in    many    cases,    all    the    possible    postsynaptic
            elements   could   be   functional,   as   particular   dyadic   or    triadic    combinations    are    found    to    occur
            in   many   instances   (for   example,   AIA   and   AIB   are    often    the    two    postsynaptic    elements    in    a
            dyadic   synapse).   Some   synaptic   pairings    are    only    seen    in    the    context    of    multiple    synapses.
            Although   this   may   suggest   that   such   a   pairing   could   be    non-functional,    there    are    cases    where
            this  cannot  be  so,  as   the   other   postsynaptic   element   of   the   dyadic   synapse   is   also   seen   only   in
            the   context   of   a   multiple   synapse   (for   example,   RIB    and    AVE    are    postsynaptic    to    AUA,    and
            AVE   and   AIZ   are   postsynaptic   to   RIG).   This   observation   raises    the    interesting    possibility    that,
            in   some   cases,   synaptogenesis   may   be   dependent   on    the    simultaneous    presence    of    two    particular
            postsynaptic elements.
              Several    process    pairs    are    seen    to    synapse    onto    each     other     reciprocally.     AVAL/R     and
            PVCL/R   synapse   onto   each   other   along   the   length   of   the   ventral   cord,   for    example,    but    there
            is   no   particular   spatial   relation   between   the   two   types   of   synapse.   The   reciprocal   synapses   made
            by   RIA   and   RMD   are   usually   situated   close    to    each    other,    however,    making    a    characteristic
            structure   (RIA-e).   Such    an    organization    may    provide    positive    or    negative    feedback    in    these
            synaptic connections.
              Many   classes   of   neuron   are   found   to   have   regions   of   process   that   are    devoid    of    presynaptic
            specializations.   This   could    be    because    the    particular    class    of    neuron    does    not    have    many
            synapses   in   total   or   that   these   regions   corresponded   to    regions    where    there    are    no    suitable
            postsynaptic    partners.    In    several    cases    neither    of    these    explanations    can    be     valid.     The
            interneurons    AVA,    AVB,    AVD    and    AVE    are    all    exclusively    postsynaptic    in    the    nerve    ring,
            yet   they    have    extensive    synaptic    outputs    in    the    ventral    cord.    Furthermore,    AVD,    AVE    and
            AVB   all    have    extensive    synapses    onto    AVA    along    the    cord;    however,    in    the    nerve    ring,
            processes   from   these   cells   do   not   make   such   synapses   even   though   they    are    accessible    to    AVA
            (i.e.  are  adjacent  to  its  processes)  for  part  of   their   extent   within   the   ring.   Thus   it   appears   that
            certain   classes   of   neuron   can   localize   the    regions    where    they    are    presynaptic.    Those    regions
            of   process   that   are   devoid   of   presynaptic   contacts   are   often   more   lightly   stained    than    adjacent
            processes (AVA-a). There seems to be no localization of postsynaptic contacts.
              Occasionally,    presynaptic    elements    are    seen    with    no    obvious    postsynaptic    partner,    or    with
            a   hypodermal   cell   as   the   only   possible   partner.   AVB   is   particularly    prone    to    this    behaviour,
            having   six   such   structures   along   the   length   of   the   ventral   cord   (see,   for   example,   AVB-a).    It
            is  difficult  to   know   how   to   interpret   these   structures;   they   could   possibly   be   functional   synapses
            and   control   some   hypodermal   cell   function   such   as   cuticle   deposition   or   moulting,   or   they    could
            be artefacts.

            Neuromuscular junctions

              Neuromuscular   junctions    (NMJs)    are    special    cases    of    chemical    synapses    where    at    least    one
            of   the   postsynaptic   elements   is   muscle.    As    the    muscle    and    nervous    system    are    situated    on
            opposite   sides   of   the   pseudocoelomic   basal   lamina,   NMJs   have   to    pass    through    the    lamina    with
            the presynaptic elements (the motoneuron axons) on one side and the main postsynaptic

            elements   (the   muscle   arms)   on    the    other.    Because    of    this    arrangement,    NMJs    are    constrained
            to   lie   on   the   two-dimensional   surface    of    the    lamina.    NMJs    usually    have    several    postsynaptic
            elements.   On   the   inside   of   the   nerve   ring,   there   is   a   continuous   plexus   of   arms   from    muscles
            in  the   head   and   a   high   density   of   NMJs   (figure   14).   In   the   ventral   cord,   the   NMJs   are   more
            dispersed   and   muscle   arms   crowd   round    and    interdigitate    at    foci    where    there    are    presynaptic
            elaborations on motoneuron axons (figure 18).
              Certain    classes    of    neuron    (VDn,    DDn,    RMD,    SMD,    RME     and     RIP)     have     processes     that
            are   postsynaptic   at   NMJs.   These   processes   are   on   the   same   side   of   the    basal    lamina    as    the
            presynaptic   elements   and   often   have   a    short    branch,    which    dips    in    and    intercepts    the    NMJ
            (see,   for   example,   RMD-a).   Because   of   this   behaviour,   it   seems   likely   that    these    processes    are
            functional    postsynaptic    elements.    The    disposition    of    the    dendritic    processes    relative    to    the
            NMJs   that   they   are    intercepting    suggests    that    the    NMJs    might    have    formed    first    and    the
            dendrites   might   have   moved   in   and   insinuated    themselves    into    position    later.    There    is    likely
            to   be   some   specificity   as   to   which   NMJs   are   intercepted   by    particular    dendrites,    as    dendrites
            along   the   ventral   cord   are   not   associated   with   the   NMJs   of   VDn   and   DDn,    but    are    associated
            with  the  NMJs   of   the   other   motoneuron   classes   active   in   the   nerve   cord,   even   though   all   classes
            of NMJ are equally accessible to the dendritic processes.
              With   the   exception   of   RIP,   all   the   classes   of   neuron   that   have   postsynaptic   elements   in    NMJs
            are    motoneurons    themselves    and,    interestingly,    have    NMJs    on    the    diametrically    opposite     side
            of  the  animal  to  the   regions   where   they   are   postsynaptic.   Thus   it   seems   likely   that   these   classes
            of   neuron   act    as    cross-inhibitors,    ensuring    that    muscle    contractions    in    diametrically    opposite
            regions   of   the   animal    operate    in    antiphase.    Neurons    analogous    to    VDn    and    DDn    have    been
            identified   in   the   ventral   cord   of   A.   lumbricoides   and   have   been   shown   to   be   inhibitory   (Johnson
            & Stretton 1980).
              The   arrangement   of   motoneuron   axons   around   the   inside   surface    of    the    nerve    ring    was    found
            to  be  the  most  highly  ordered   region   of   neuropile   in   the   nervous   system   (figure   14.).   The   ordering
            is   such   that   it   is   often   possible   to   identify   many   of   the   processes   in   this   region   by   their
            appearance   in   a   single   appropriately   positioned   section.   Several   of   the   NMJs   in   this    region    are
            organized    as    characteristic    complexes    made    up    of     presynaptic     endings     clustered     around     a
            dendritic   process   (figure   14).   The   dendritic   processes   are    from    RMD,    SMD    and    RIP.    The    NMJs
            made    by    RMD    and    SMD    are    situated    diametrically    opposite    their     dendritic     processes.     The
            RIP   neurons   also   have   processes   that   cross   over   to    the    diametrically    opposite    side    from    the
            dendritic    regions,    even    though    they    are    not    motoneurons.    These     processes     eventually     enter
            the pharynx (Ward et al. I975; Albertson & Thomson 1976).
              The   arms   from   each   row   of   head   muscles   are   arranged   around   the   inside   surface   of   the    nerve
            ring   such   that   arms   from   each   row   occupy   a   well-defined   arc.   This   arc    is    positioned    in    an
            equivalent   location   to   that   of   the   muscle   row   from   which   the   arms   originated   (figure   15).   There
            is   thus   a   fairly   precise   mapping   of   the   circumferential   positions   of   the   muscle    rows,    by    the
            muscle   arms,   onto   the   motor   endplate    region.    The    ordering    of    the    motoneuron    axons    on    one
            side  of  the  basal  lamina   and   the   muscle   arms   on   the   other   is   highest   at   the   regions   immediately
            adjacent to the lamina but is less apparent away from it.
              The  flattened  processes  of   the   GLR   cells   cover   the   inside   surface   of   the   plexus   of   muscle   arms
            inside  the  nerve   ring   and   are   seen   to   have   gap   junctions   with   adjacent   muscle   arms   (figure   15).
            The   processes   of   GLR   are   found   to   be   aligned   with   the   arcs   of   muscle    arms    from    each    row
            (figure 14). The sub-dorsal and sub-ventral sets (GLRDL/R and GLRVL/R) are each

                                                   THE MIND OF A WORM                                                              31

          associated   with   muscle   arms   from   one   row,    whereas    the    lateral    pair    (GLRL/R)    are    larger    in
          circumference   and   are   each    associated    with    two    muscle    rows.    The    points    of    contact    between
          adjacent  GLR  processes  are  closely   aligned   with   the   points   of   contact   of   the   arcs   of   muscle   arms,
          except  in  the  case  of  the  muscle  rows  lying  either  side  of  the   lateral   lines.   In   these,   there   is   no
          GLR  process  junction  and   a   certain   amount   of   mixing   of   the   muscle   arms   at   the   point   of   contact
          of   adjacent   arcs   occurs,   whereas   there   is   no   mixing   at   the   points   of    contact    that    have    an
          associated   GLR    process    junction.    These    observations    suggest    that    the    GLR    processes    may    act
          to  guide  muscle  arms  and   confine   them   to   their   appropriate   territories   on   the   inside   of   the   nerve
          ring.

          FIGURE 14. Neuromuscular junctions in the nerve ring. The eight rows of muscles in the head and neck (figure 10)
             have muscle arms that project onto  the  inside  surface  of  the  nerve  ring  in  a  highly  ordered  way  (figure  15).
             They  are  sandwiched  between  the  thin  sheet-like  processes  of  GLR  cells  on  the  inside  and   the   motoneurons
             of the nerve ring on the  outside.  Four  spurs  of  muscle  arm  penetrate  into  the  anterior  neuropile  of  the  ring
             sub-laterally and receive synaptic inputs from RIM,  which  runs  in  the  interior  of  the  ring  neuropile.  The  other
             classes of motoneuron form complex, but well-defined, structures  adjacent  to  the  inner  surface  of  the  nerve  ring.
             Most  NMJs  are  dyadic,  with  dendrites  of  other  motoneuron  classes  or  RIP  as  the  corecipients.  The  dots   in
             the processes show the locations of the presynaptic specializations.

            One   motoneuron,   RIM,   is   unusual   in   that   it   does   not   have   its   axon   adjacent    to    the    inside
          surface   of   the   nerve   ring.   Instead   it   forms   NMJs   onto   four   spurs   of   muscle   arms    that    invade
          the  neuropile  of  the  ring  (figure  14:).  It  is  difficult  to  visualize  the   basal   lamina   in   these   regions,
          so  it   is   not   clear   whether   the   muscle   arms   actually   penetrate   the   basal   lamina   at   these   points
          or   whether   the   basal   lamina   is   herniated.   The   sites   of   these   invaginations    again    correspond    to
          junctions   between   GLR   processes   and   are    fairly    small;    muscle    arms    anterior    and    posterior    to

            FIGURE. 15. Head and neck muscle projections. The muscle arms from the 32 head and neck muscles send arms
               posteriorly past the outside surface of the nerve ring. These then turn  and  run  anteriorly  onto  the  inside  surface
               of the ring. The muscle arms  are  highly  ordered  in  this  region  and  map  onto  the  inside  surface  according  to
               the  circumferential  location  of  the  muscle  bellies.  Muscle  arms  have  gap  junctions  to  arms   from   adjacent
               muscles  in  neighbouring  quadrants  and  to  GLR  cells.  RME  motoneurons  also  have  gap  junctions  to  GLR   cells
               in  the  arrangement  shown.  There  are  gap  junctions  between  the  muscle  bellies  of  muscles  in  adjacent   rows
               of the same quadrant but,  interestingly,  none  are  seen  between  the  arms  from  these  muscles,  even  though  they
               interdigitate extensively.

              There   are   seven   main    classes    of    motoneuron    in    the    ventral    cord'    VAn,    DAn,    VBn,    DBn,
            ASn,   VDn   and   DDn.   Members   of   each   class    are    evenly    distributed    along    the    length    of    the
            cord   (White   et   al.   1976).   Within   each   class   there   are   sharply   defined    transition    points    where
            one   axon   becomes    synaptically    active,    having    many    NMJs    along    the    cord,    and    the    adjacent
            axon    becomes    inactive,    having    no    more    NMJs.    These    transition    points     occur     in     slightly
            different   positions   for   each   class;    such    observations    suggest    that    there    might    be    intraclass
            competition    for    territory    along    the    ventral    cord    (White    et    al.    1976).    Similar    intraclass
            competitions   for   territories   have   been   shown   to   occur   in   two   dimensions   for   classes   of    ganglion
            cell  in   the   vertebrate   retina   (Wassle   et   al.   1981).   In   the   nerve   ring,   many   of   the   motoneuron
            classes   have   NMJs   at   discrete   points   around   the   motor   endplate   region   and   so   it   seems   unlikely
            that   intraclass   competition   has   a   role    in    establishing    NMJ    territories    in    these    cases.    The
            RMDD/V    motoneurons    have    NMJs    around    the    whole    circumference    of    the    ring,     however,     with
            abrupt   transitions   between    adjacent    class    members,    which    each    have    NMJs    over    a    45ø    arc.
            Thus   it   seems   possible   that,   in   this   case,   intraclass   competition   may   be   used   to   partition   out
            territory for NMJs to the class members.

                   THE MIND OF A WORM                                                                                                                        33

           The organization of processes within bundles

             The  process   bundles   in   C.   elegans   are   spatially   ordered,   with   processes   running   in   characteristic
           positions    within    the    bundle    and    maintaining    their    locations     relative     to     their     immediate
           neighbours   over   long   distances.   This   ordering   is   independent   of   the   size   of   the   process    bundle.
           For  example,   the   four   anterior   sub-lateral   cords,   which   are   made   up   of   only   two   processes,   each
           have  the   same   relative   disposition   of   processes   (figure   7).   On   the   other   hand,   the   ventral   cord
           near  the  junction  of  the  nerve  ring  is  made   up   of   about   170   processes;   it   is   bilaterally   symmetric
           in  this  region   and   the   degree   of   order   that   was   found   can   be   seen   by   comparing   the   positions
           of  bilaterally  symmetrical  processes  on  each  side   of   the   cord   (figure   16b).   There   is   a   little   more
           variability   seen   between   the   cords   of   different   animals   of   the    same    genotype    and    developmental
           stage   than   between   each   side   of   the   cord   in   a   single   animal.   Although   the   order   of   processes
           in   the   cord   is   maintained   over   long   distances,   local   mechanical   intrusions,   such   as   cell   bodies,
           can disturb the ordering temporarily, but order returns away from these regions.
             Processes   that   must   have   grown   in   opposite   directions    are    found    to    be    freely    mixed    within
           process   bundles.   The    processes    of    PVQR    and    PVPR    in    the    ventral    cord,    for    example,    must
           have   grown   up   from   their   cell   bodies   in   the   tail,    yet    most    of    their    surrounding    processes,
           such   as   those   of   AVAL,   HSNR   and   AVJL   (figure   18b),   have   their   cell   bodies   in    the    head    and
           their   processes   must   therefore   have   grown   in   opposite   directions    to    those    of   PVQ and   PVP.    The
           relative   positions   of   adjacent   processes   that   had   grown   in   opposite   directions   was    fairly    constant
           over    long    distances.    Such    an    organization    of    processes    might    conceivably     have     arisen     by
           rapid   and   sequential   process   growth;   in   other   words,    each    process    would    grow    along    the    full
           length   of   the   process   bundle   before   its   neighbour   growing   in   the   opposite   direction    started    out.
           A   more    likely    explanation    for    these    observations    is    that    processes    can    insinuate    themselves
           in    between    pre-existing    processes    in    a    bundle    and    follow    along     specific     neighbours.     The
           observation   that   the   processes   of   PVNL   in   the   left   sub-dorsal   region    of    the    nerve    ring    must
           have   grown   in   opposite   directions,   but   nevertheless,   ran   in   the   same   region   of   the    nerve    ring,
           supports this latter interpretation.
             Any   individual   process    in    a    bundle    has    a    group    of    adjacent    processes    that    immediately
           surround   it   at   any   point.   We   refer   to   such   a   group   as    the    neighbourhood    of    the    process.
           Neighbourhoods    are    generally    fairly    constant    over    the    length    of    processes,     reflecting     the
           ordered    arrangement    of    processes    within    bundles.    Certain    neighbours    are    found    to    be    much
           more   persistent   than   others,    however,    always    remaining    adjacent,    whereas    others    move    in    and
           out  of  direct  adjacency   along   the   length   of   the   process   (White   et   al.   1983).   In   some   instances,
           groups  of  processes  are   seen   to   be   closely   associated   together;   the   most   striking   example   of   this
           behaviour   is   shown   by   the   dendritic    regions    of    RMD    motoneurons,    which    are    clustered    around
           the   processes   of   RIA   (RMD-d).   In   this   particular   case   there   are    extensive    synaptic    interactions
           between   RIA   and   RMD,   but   in   other   cases,   such   as    the    close    association    of    ALM    and    ALN
           on    the    lateral    lines    (ALN-d),    there    are    no    synaptic    interactions    between    the     associated
           processes.
             Many    processes    make    abrupt    changes    of    neighbourhood    at    certain    points.    The    processes    of
           AIB  are  closely  associated  with  those   of   AIA   on   the   ipsilateral   side,   but   at   the   point   where   the
           latter   terminate,   on   the   dorsal   mid-line,   the   processes   of   AIB   turn   and   run   across   the    process
           bundle.   They   then   run   for   a   short   distance   anteriorly   before    turning    again    and    continuing    on
           their trajectories round the ring; they are now in a different neighbourhood, where they run

            in close  association  with  the  processes  of  RIM  (White  et  al.  1983).  Such  major  changes  of
            neighbourhood  obviously  have  considerable   functional   significance   for   a   neuron   as   they
            provide an extended  set  of  possible  synaptic  partners.  Perhaps,  more  significantly,  they  also
            facilitate direct communication between non-adjacent neighbourhoods.
              In many (but not all) cases, there are external discontinuities at  the  transition  points  between
            neighbourhoods. The greatest numbers of neighbourhood transitions are seen to occur at the
            junction of two process bundles. In the region where the amphid commissure (figure 17) joins
            the  anterior  ventral  cord  (figure  16b),  most  processes  from  the  commissure  make  transitions
            of  neighbourhood  (as  in  ASG)  although  some   neighbours   are   maintained   (as   in   AIB/AWC).
            The same  type  of  behaviour  occurs  at  the  junction  of  the  ventral  cord  and  the  nerve  ring
            (figures 16  and  20),  with  some  processes  maintaining  their  neighbourhoods  (see,  for  example,
            ASJ/PVO_JASK)  while  others  (e.g.  ASH)  switch.  A  discontinuity  of  a  different  type  is   seen
            on the dorsal mid-line of the  nerve  ring,  which  corresponds  to  the  points  where  AIB,  AVE  and
            AVD  make  abrupt  transitions  of  neighbourhood.  In  this  case  the  discontinuity  is   apparently
            due to the termination of many  processes  in  this  region  (notably  the  amphid  receptor  neurons),
            usually in  gap  junctions  to  their  symmetrical  analogues  (e.g.  ASJ-c).  AIB  and  AVE  are  both
            closely associated with processes that terminate in  this  way  in  one  of  their  neighbourhoods.  In
            AVD, the associated  processes  are  not  obvious  and  it  appears  that  the  processes  of  AVD  may
            have been deflected by a process emanating out of the cell body of RID (AVD-e).
              Motoneurons  are  generally  found  to  inhabit  two  neighbourhoods.   One   corresponds   to   the
            region  where  the  motoneuron  is  predominantly  or  exclusively  postsynaptic,   usually   in   the
            interior of a process bundle, and the other is the region where NMJs  are  situated,  at  the  surface
            ora process bundle adjacent  to  the  basal  lamina.  The  transitions  between  these  neighbourhoods
            are not accompanied  by  obvious  external  discontinuities  in  most  cases,  except  for  a  similar
            transition occurring in an adjacent motoneuron of the same class.
              Groups  of  processes  that  are  fasciculated  together  have  been  shown  to   share   a   common
            antigenic  determinant  in  the  leech  (Hockfield  &  McKay  1983)   and   the   grasshopper   (Raper
            et al. 1983). It is  possible  that  such  antigens  are  neighbourhood-specific  adhesion  molecules.
            Such specific adhesion molecules, or  perhaps  a  single  ubiquitous  molecule,  such  as  CAM,  which
            is spatially and temporally regulated (Edelman  1983),  may  be  the  basis  for  the  close  associa-
            tions of groups of processes seen in the nervous system of C. elegans. It is interesting  to  consider
            the abrupt changes in neighbourhood  exhibited  by  some  neurons  in  the  context  of  inter-process
            adhesivity. In the switches in  neighbourhood  that  Occur  at  process  bundle  junctions,  it  seems
            likely  that  mechanical  disturbances  have  mixed  the  processes,   introducing   them   to   novel
            neighbours.  Some  of  these  neighbours  may  have   high   adhesive   affinities   for   the   newly
            introduced processes and act to guide and  establish  the  processes  in  their  new  territory.  Such
            a notion carries the  implication  that  specific  neighbourhoods  are  not  uniquely  attractive  for
            a particular process, but rather  that  there  may  be  several  neighbourhoods  in  which  a  process
            could equally well reside,  the  one  selected  being  dependent  on  the  initial  placement  of  the
            process in the bundle. In general there are few  directed  movements  of  neurons  relative  to  their
            neighbours after they are  born  (Sulston  1983).  It  therefore  seems  that  the  initial  placement
            of a neuron at birth is the major factor that  determines  which  neighbourhood  is  finally  selected
            out of the set of neighbourhoods in which its process could equally well reside.
                The neighbourhood transitions exhibited by motoneurons seem to be mediated by factors
            that are intrinsic to the neuron. Other neurons, such as AVA and AVB, show a clear

            FIGURE. 18. Transverse section through the ventral cord (above) and process identifications (below). The ventral
               cord  consists  of  a  process   bundle   that   runs   alongside   a   longitudinal   ridge   of   hypodermis;   the   whole   structure
               is  bounded   by   a   thin   basal   lamina   (BL).   Axons   of   motoneurons   arrange   themselves   next   to   the   basal   lamina
               on  the  right-hand  side  of  the  cord  in   a   fixed   arrangement.   The   usual   sequence   of motoneuron   classes   from   dorsal
               to  ventral  is  VCn,  VDn,  DDn,  VAn,  and  VBn.  NMJs  are   made   in   this   region   (one   from   a   VD3   is   seen   in   this
               section);   the   motoneurons   synapse   through   the   basal   lamina   onto   muscle   arms   (MA)   from   both   left   and   right
               ventral  muscle   quadrants.   The   NMJs   of   a   motoneuron   are   in   a   well-defined   region   along   its   process;   outside
               this  region,  the  process  moves  away  from   the   basal   lamina   to   the   ventral   regions   of   the   process   bundle.   The
               VDn   and   DDn   neurons   are   an   exception   in   that   their   processes   terminate   abruptly   outside   the   NMJ    regions.
               The  cell  bodies  of  the  motoneurons  that  innervate  body  muscles  are   arranged   in   a   linear   sequence   in   the   ventral
               cord  (figure  4).  The  ventral  cord   also   contains   the   interneurons   that   synapse   onto   these   motoneurons   and   other
               interneurons  with  little  or  no  synaptic  activity  in  the  cord.  The  arrangement   of   processes   in   the   cord   is   fairly
               consistent  along  the  length  of   the   cord,   although   there   may   be   local   distortions.   Fingers   of   hypodermis   (HDC)
               often   project   from   hypodermal   cells   and   run   along   the   cord   for   short   distances.   Muscle   cells   have    darkly
               staining, conical, dense bodies (DB) in the Z bands.

           FIGURE 19. Transverse section through the dorsal cord (above) and process identifications (below). The dorsal cord
              is similar in overall structure to the ventral cord but is much simpler, as it has fewer processes and  no  cell  bodies.
              The processes in  the  dorsal  cord  are  all  motoneuron  axones  except  for  the  processes  of  VDn  and  RMED.  DAn,
              DBn, ASn, DDn and VDn  all  have  processes  in  the  dorsal  cord  that  originate  from  cell  bodies  in  the  ventral
              cord via circumferential commissures (figure  7).  RID  sends,a  process  along  the  length  of  dorsal  cord  from  its
              cell body, which is situated in the dorsal ganglion.

           that   are   exclusively   postsynaptic.   In   the   case   of   motoneurons   it   is   not   clear   whether   there   are
           no   synapses   made   by   the   axon   when   it   is   in   the   interior   of   the   process   bundle   because   there
           are   no   suitable   postsynaptic   targets    (muscle    arms)    available    in    the    neighbourhood,    or    whether
           this   region   of   the   process   is   intrinsically    incapable    of    supporting    synapses.    If    this    latter
           interpretation  is  correct,  it   may   be   that   particular   adhesion   factors   are   also   associated   with   these
           differentiated   regions   of   the   process.   A   factor   that   was    localized    in    presynaptic    regions    that
           conferred   an   adhesive   affinity   with   the   basal   lamina   could,   for   example,   serve   to    constrain    the
           process to run alongside the basal lamina in these regions.

               so   there   are   no   single   corresponding   electron   micrographs.   The   large   outlines    peripheral    to    the    neuropile
               are  cell  bodies.  The  relative  disposition  of  processes  in  the   nerve   ring   is   relatively   constant;   several   processes
               can  usually  be  identified  directly  from   an   electron   micrograph   by   their   morphology   and   position   in   the   process
               bundle.  The   axonal   regions   of   motoneurons   are   situated   adjacent   to   the   anterior   inner   surface   of   the   nerve
               ring  and  synapse  onto  muscle  arms  through  a  basal  lamina.  The  processes  of   GLR   cells   flatten   out   in   this   region
               and  form  a  cylinder  on  the  inside  of  the  muscle  arms.  The  neuropile  of  the  ring  is  fairly   regionalized;   the   amphid
               receptors  and  their  associated  interneurons  have   processes   in   the   posterior   of   the   ring,   the   neurons   that   make
               up  the  sub-lateral   cords   have   their   processes   in   the   centre   and   the   mechanoreceptors   tend   to   have   processes
               in the anterior regions.

           was   also   given   as   to    whether    the    synaptic    contacts    were    all    dyadic    (with    the    consequent
           ambiguities in the identification of the functional postsynaptic partners) and whether they were

           present   on   symmetrical   analogues,   or   corresponding   cells   in   another   animal.   In   the    case    of    gap
           junctions,  the  main   criteria   were   the   area   of   contact   and   darkness   of   staining   of   the   structures,
           and   again   whether   they    were    present    between    analogous    partners    in    the    same    or    in    other
           animals.

           Triangular patterns of connectivity

             One   of   the   striking   features   of   the   connectivity   diagrams   is   the   high   incidence    of    triangular
           connections   linking   three   classes.    These    structures    may    occur    frequently    as    a    consequence    of
           the  organization  of  the   neuropile.   A   typical   neuron   in   C.   elegans   is   accessible   (i.e.   adjacent)   to
           a  fairly  limited   subset   of   the   total   complement   of   neurons   but   is   fairly   highly   locally   connected
           within  this  subset   (White   et   al.   1983).   Thus,   if a   neuron   has   synaptic   contacts   with   two   partners,
           these   two   partners   must   be   neighbours   to   the   neuron   and   therefore   are   likely   to    be    neighbours
           themselves.  It   is   therefore   quite   probable,   given   the   high   level   of   local   connectivity,   that   there
           will   be   a   synaptic   contact   between    them,    which    will    close    the    triangle.    The    abundance    of
           triangular   connections   in   the   nervous   system   of   C.   elegans   may   thus   simply   be   a   consequence    of
           the high levels of connectivity that are present within neighbourhoods.

           Gap junction circuitry

           Of   the   104   classes   of   neuron   in   the   main   (i.e.   non-pharyngeal)    nervous    system,    92    have    gap
           junctions.   Many   of   these   classes   make   gap   junctions   to   members   of   their   own   class   if   they   are
           accessible  to  them   (48   classes   form   such   intraclass   junctions).   This   is   in   marked   contrast   to   the
           chemical    synapses,    where     unambiguous     synapses     between     members     of     the     same     class     are
           extremely   rare.   Gap   junctions   are   the    presumed    mediators    of    electrical    coupling    between    cells,
           and  so  it  seems  likely  that  the   gap   junctions   seen   between   members   of   a   class   may   act   to   smooth
           discontinuities    of    electrical    activity    between    adjacent    class    members.    This    may    be    important
           for   classes    such    as    the    ventral    cord    motoneurons,    for    example,    where    marked differences    in
           activity    of    adjacent    motoneurons    may    be    inimical    to    the    smooth    wave    propagation     required
           for locomotion.
             Many   neurons   have   a   process   that   terminates   at   its   point   of   contact   with   a   process    from    a
           neuron   of   the   same   class.   Most   of   the   neurons   of   the   amphid   sensilla   behave   in   this   way,   as
           do   the   DDn   and   VDn   motoneurons   of   the   ventral   cord.    In    nearly    all    the    cases    where    this
           apparent  contact   termination   of   process   growth   is   seen,   there   is   a   gap   junction   at   the   site   of
           contact.   (The   processes   of   RIF   on   the   dorsal   mid-line   are    the    one    striking    counterexample    to
           this   general   rule.)    It    seems    possible    that,    in    these    cases,    gap    junctions    may    facilitate
           intercellular communication of the signals for inhibiting process extension.

                             Functional classification of neuron  classes

             The   simplest   functional   groupings   of   neurons    that    are    usually    made    are    their    categorizations
           as   either    receptor    neurons,    interneurons    or    motoneurons.    We    have    used    symbols    to    represent
           these   neuron   types   in   the   connectivity   graphs   of   figure   21.   Assignment   of   a   particular   class   to
           a   group   is,   however,   not   straightforward;   several   neuronal   classes   have   to   be    assigned    to    more
           than   one   group,   because   they   appear   to   combine   two   or   more   of   these   basic   functions.   We    will
           go on to discuss some of the characteristics of neurons in each of these three major groupings.

            Sensory receptors

               The    lack     of     electrophysiological     data     on     any     of     the     neurons     of     C.     elegans     makes     the
             identification     of     sensory     receptors     and     their     associated     modalities     rather     tentative.      We      have,
             however,    selected    a    set    of    39    neurons,    which,    on    the    basis    of    morphology    and    connectivity,     are
             likely to function as sensory receptors; these have been listed in table 1.

               The    component    neurons    of    sensilla    are    the    neurons    that    are    most     likely     to     have     a     sensory
             transduction    function    (Ward    et    al.    1975).    There    are    two    general    types     of     sensillum:     those     that
             have    channels    that    open    to    the    outside,    exposing    some    or    all    of    the    neurons    to    the     external
             chemical environment, and those that have no such channel. The former class is generally

            neurons   of   sensilla   are   all   ciliated   and   some   of   the   presumed   mechanoreceptors   also   have    ciliary
            rootlets.  There  are  several   other   classes   of   neurons   that   are   not   components   of   sensilla   but   which
            we  suspect   may   be   sensory   transducers;   these   are   also   listed   in   table   1.   The   factors   that   have
            been  taken  as  being   indicative   of   a   possible   sensory   function   are:   the   presence   of   a   cilium,   the
            presence   of   a    specialized,    morphologically    differentiated    ending    or    the    presence    of    a    long,
            morphologically   undifferentiated   process   that   projects   into    the    extremities    (the    tailspike    or    the
            tip  of  the   head).   In   addition   to   these   criteria,   all   the   putative   receptors   should   be   exclusively
            or predominantly presynaptic.
              Of   the   putative   receptors   listed   in   table    1,    one    group    has    a    definitely    known    modality;
            another's   is   known   with   a   fair   degree   of   confidence.    Laser    ablation    studies    have    shown    that
            ALM,     PLM,     AVM     and     probably     PVM     transduce     touch,     i.e.      light      mechanical      pressure
            (Chalfie   &   Sulston   1981).   The   amphid   sensilla    are    strongly    implicated    as    being    necessary    for
            the     chemotaxis     response,     as     several     chemotaxis-defective     mutants     have     aberrant      amphidial
            neurones (Lewis & Hodgkin 1977).

            Interneurons

              The  interneurons  in   C.   elegans   are   fairly   diverse   in   their   general   organization,   but   some   classes
            are   conspicuous   in   that   they   are   restricted   in   the   classes   of   neuron   with   which   they    interact.
            The   interneurons    AIA,    AIB,    AIY    and    AIZ,    for    instance,    receive    synaptic    input    predominantly
            from   the   neurons   of   the   amphid   sensilla   (figure   21   a),   whereas   RIC   receives   its   synaptic    input
            from    putative     mechanoreceptors     (figure     21b).     Other     interneurons     do     not     show     such     a
            restriction    in    sensory    modalities    and    receive    synaptic    input    from    many    sources    (see,     for
            example, AVA).
              The  only  other  striking   grouping   that   is   seen   in   interneurones   is   of   the   classes   whose   synaptic
            outputs   are   directed    primarily    to    motoneurons.    These    classes    are    AVA,    AVB,    AVD,    AVE    and
            PVC,    which    synapse    onto    motoneurons    in    the    ventral    cord,    and    RIA,    which    synapses    onto
            motoneurons    in    the    nerve    ring.    These    interneuron    classes    are    among     the     most     prominent
            neurons   in   the   whole   nervous   system.    They    generally    have    larger-diameter    processes    than    other
            neurons and have many synaptic connections.

            Motoneurons

              Each   of   the   motoneurons   in   C.   elegans   innervates   a   specific   group   of   muscle    cells.    This    is
            particularly    noticeable    in    the    head    region,    where    there    is    a    fairly    precise    mapping    of
            motoneurons    onto    their    target    muscles.    Body-wall    muscles    are    innervated     by     motoneurons     in
            both   the   nerve   ring   and   ventral   cord.   Each   of   these   regions   of neuropile   contains   its   own   unique
            set   of   motoneuron   classes.   The   body-wall   muscles    can    be    logically    divided    into    three    regions
            according    to    the    source    of    innervation:    the    head    region,    which    receives    innervation     from
            motoneurons   in   the   nerve    ring,    the    neck    region,    which    is    dually    innervated    by    motoneurons
            of   the   nerve   ring   and   ventral   cord,   and   the   rest   of   the   body   region,   which   is   innervated   by
            motoneurons of the ventral cord (figure 10).
              Each   member   of   a   motoneuron   class   in   the    nerve    ring    generally    innervates    muscle    cells    in
            two   adjacent    rows    (table    2).    Motoneuron    classes    with    fourfold    symmetry    innervate    all    eight
            rows   of   muscle    with    no    overlap,    whereas    motoneurons    with    sixfold    symmetry    have    fields    of
            innervation that overlap with each other by one row on each side but not across the

           dorso-ventral     mid-line     (table     2).     Most     of     the     classes     of     motoneuron     with     bilateral      symmetry
           innervate    only    the    lateral    four    rows;    the    exception    is    RIV,    which     only     innervates     ventral     rows
           (table 2).
             In     addition     to     the     intraclass     circumferential     mapping     shown     by     the     ring     motoneurons      there
           is     also     some     anteroposterior     mapping     between     classes;     some      motoneuron      classes      only      innervate
           head muscles, some only neck muscles, while others innervate both (tables 2 and 3).

                        ú , only the most anterior members of the class make these NMJs.

            VCn     motoneurons     also     innervate     the     ventral     body     muscles     but      the      HSNs      never      do      this,
            synapsing    exclusively     onto     the     vulval     muscles.     The     other     classes     of     motoneuron     that     innervate
            ventral    body    muscles    (VAn,    VBn    and    VDn)    also    have     a     few     synapses     onto     the     vulval     muscles
            (figure 11), thus the HSNs appear to be the only neurons that are specific for these muscles.
              The   only   motoneuron    class    that    has    been    seen    to    synapse    onto    the    set    of    muscles    that    mediate
            defecation    is    DVB,    but    only    via    a    single    synapse     onto     the     intestinal     muscles.     The     defecation
            muscles   are   all   coupled   together   via   gap   junctions,    so    it    is    possible    that    this    single    synapse    from
            DVB    is    the    route    by    which    defecation    is    controlled    from    the    central    nervous     system.     DVB     also
            makes a few synapses onto body muscles.
              Several     motoneuron     classes      have      long,      apparently      undifferentiated      processes,      distal      to      the
            regions where NMJs are situated, before they eventually terminate (table 3). It has been
                                            -..
            suggested    in    the    case    of    the    ventral    cord    motoneurons    VA,    DA,    VB    and    DB,    that    these     regions
            may     function     as     stretch     receptors     (L.     Byerly     and     R.      L.      Russell,      personal      communication).
            These     processes     will     be     stretched     when     the     body     bends.     This     arrangement     of     the      stretch-
            receptive    region    adjacent    to     the     NMJ     region     will     therefore     result     in     body     curvature's     being
            transduced    into    motor    activity    in    an    adjacent    region.    This    will    mediate     the     translation     of     the
            region     of     curvature     along     the     body.     The     ring     motoneurons     have     processes     that     run     circum-
            ferentially    around    the    nerve    ring.    Two    classes    of    motoneuron    in     the     nerve     ring     have     processes
            that    leave    the    nerve    ring    distally    from    the    region    where     their     NMJs     are     situated     (SMB     and
            SMD).     These     processes     turn     and     run     longitudinally     down     the      sub-lateral      cords.      Running      in
            these   locations,   these   processes   are   ideally    situated    to    monitor    bend    in    the    anterior    body,    if    these
            processes    have    a    stretch-transducing    function.    This    would    not    be    the    case,    however,     if     they     ran
            round the nerve ring following on from their proximal regions.
              Several classes of motoneuron have processes that are postsynaptic at the NMJs of other
                                                                                                 4-2

            neuron    classes    (table    3),    and    have    their     NMJs     diametrically     opposite     these     postsynaptic
            regions.   There   is   nearly   always   another   neuron   present,   of   the   same   or   similar   class,   which   has
            the   converse   arrangement   of   postsynaptic   and   presynaptic    regions,    i.e.    it    has    NMJs    where    its
            partner   is   postsynaptic   and   is   itself   postsynaptic   in   the   diametrically   opposite   region    where    its
            partner   has   NMJs   (the   DDn   neurons   in   the    L1    are    notable    exceptions    to    this    generalization-
            White   et   al.   1978).   This   reciprocal   arrangement   of   pairs   of   such   neurons   suggests   that   they   may
            act   as   reciprocal   inhibitors,   picking   up   excitatory   synaptic   input   to   muscles    from    other    classes
            of  neuron  and  relaying  this  round  to   the   other   side   of   the   animal   as   an   inhibitory   input   to   the
            diametrically   opposite   muscles,    ensuring    that    they    work    in    antiphase.    The    postsynaptic    regions
            of   these   putative   cross-inhibitor   classes   often   receive    a    few    synapses    from    their    contralateral
            partners   (RMD   has    rather    more    of    these    connections    than    other    motoneuron    classes    of    this
            type).  If  these   synapses   are   inhibitory,   as   is   assumed   to   be   the   case   for   the   NMJs,   then   they
            could  add   a   certain   amount   of   positive   feedback   to   the   system.   This   would   have   the   effect   that
            when   the   other   (i.e.   non-cross-inhibitor)   neuron   classes   are   activated,   the    system    would    act    as
            a   bi-stable   switch   with   one   side   activated   and   the   other   inhibited.   If   the   cross-inhibitors    have
            a   time   dependent   component   in   their   response   to    stimulation,    then    the    system    could    oscillate,
            one side being activated after the other in succession.
              Two   classes   of   motoneuron   that   have   their   NMJs   in   the   nerve   ring,   IL1    and    URA,    are    also
            probably   sensory   receptors.   The   IL1   neurons   are   components    of    the    inner    labial    sensilla;    they
            may   respond   to   mechanical   stimulation    at    the    extreme    tip    of    the    head.    Presumably    such    a
            simple   connection   acting   directly   on   to   muscles   can   only    mediate    a    simple    withdrawal    response.
            The   function   of   URA   is   not   clear;   it   is   probably   a   sensory   receptor   as    it    is    predominantly
            presynaptic   in   the   ring   and   sends   processes   to   the   tip   of   the   head,   but    the    appearance    and
            disposition of these presumed sensory endings gives no indication as to their sensory modality.

                                     Connectivity

              The   availability   of   the   complete   connectivity   data   for    a    nervous    system    generates    an    almost
            irresistible  desire  to   speculate   extensively   on   the   function   of   such   a   structure.   We   will,   however,
            try   to   resist   this   temptation   and   leave   such   speculations   for   future   work,   when    we    hope    that
            they   can   be   backed   up   by   corroborative   experimental   data.   We    will,    therefore,    try    to    confine
            our   comments   to   the   general   features   of   the   connectivity,   some   of    which    may    not    be    obvious
            from   the   connectivity   diagrams,   and   to   the   functional   aspects   of   those    parts    of    the    circuitry
            for which there is some relevant experimental data.

            Amphids (figure 21 a)

              The    neurons    of    the    amphid    sensilla    have    synaptic    outputs    that    are    predominantly    focused
            onto   four   interneurons:   AIA,   AIB,   AIY   and   AIZ.   Most   ef    the    receptors    that    are    situated    in
            the   amphid    channel    synapse    onto    the    AIA-AIB    pair,    whereas    most    of    the    accessory    neurons
            that   are   associated   with    the    amphid    sheath    cells    synapse    onto    AIY-AIZ.    The    amphid    channel
            receptor,  ASJ,  is  unusual   in   that   it   alone   synapses   onto   none   of   the   four   main   amphid   associated
            interneuron   classes,   but   instead   synapses   onto   PVQ,   an    interneuron    class    that    has    cell    bodies
            in   the   tail.   PVQ   also   receives   synaptic   input   from   the   phasmid   receptor   neurons,    PHA,    in    the
            tail,   and   synapses   onto   AIA,   thereby    providing    an    indirect    route    from    ASJ    onto    the    major
            interneurons.
              The    interneurons    AIA    and    AIB    generally    receive     a     common     synaptic     input     from     their
            presynaptic partners. These are usually (but not exclusively) mediated by dyadic synapses,

                    THE MIND OF A WORM                                                                                                                          53

           with the closely associated processes of AIA and AIB being the postsynaptic elements. There
           is   generally   a   bias   to   AIA,   in   that   receptor    neurons    often    have    additional    monadic    synapses
           to   AIA   or   dyadic   synapses   to   AIA   with   an    alternative    co-recipient.    The    main    synaptic    output
           of   AIA   is   onto   AIB,   and   this   closes   the   triangles   made   by   all   the   neurons   that   synapse   onto
           both   AIA   and   AIB.   The   output   from   these   triangular   subcircuits    is    derived    from    AIB    and    is
           mainly directed to the nerve ring motoneurons, RIM, and the ventral cord interneurons, AVB.
              The   interneurons   AIY    and    AIZ    do    not    make    as    many    triangular    connections    as    are    seen
            on   AIA   and   AIB,   although   AIY   synapses   onto   AIZ   in    an    analogous    way    to    the    synapse    from
            AIA   onto   AIB.   The   main   synaptic   outputs    of    both    AIY    and    AIZ    are    onto    RIA    interneurons,
            which   in   turn   synapse   onto    the    putative    cross-inhibitor    motoneurons    of    the    nerve    ring,    RMD
            and SMD.
              Several   of   the   receptor   neurons   make   direct   synaptic   contacts   with    some    of    the    other    major
            interneurons,    thereby    bypassing    the    AIA-AIB-AIY-AIZ    system.    Most    notable    of     these     are     the
            connections    made    by    ASH    and    ADF    onto    RIA    and    the    somewhat    less     prominent     connections
            made by ASH and ADL onto the ventral cord interneurons AVA, AVB and AVD.
              There    are    several    instances    of    receptor    neurons    synapsing     directly     onto     other     receptor
            neurons.   Some   of   these   synapses   are   quite   striking   (that   of   ASE    onto    AWC,    for    example)    and
            some    receptors    synapse    onto    more    than    one    other    receptor.    These     receptor-receptor     synapses
            are   not   peculiar   to   the   amphid   receptors   as   they   are   seen   between    many    different    classes    of
            receptor    neuron,     although     the     amphid     receptors     predominantly     synapse     onto     other     amphid
            receptors.   It   seems   likely    that    such    receptor-receptor    connections    facilitate    the    modulation    of
            the activity of one receptor by another.

            Other receptors in the head and their associated interneurons (figure 21 b)

              Many   of   the   putative   sensory   receptors   in   the   head,   apart   from   those   of   the   amphid    sensilla,
            have   connections   either   directly    or    indirectly    to    the    five    major    classes    of'    ventral    cord
            interneuron    that    innervate    body    muscles    (AVA,    AVB,    AVD,    AVE     and     PVC).     OLL     and     CEP
            synapse   directly   onto    AVE;    CEP    and    OLQ.    synapse    onto    RIC,    which    in    turn    synapses    onto
            AVA,   for   example.   There   are   also   connections   to   the   motoneurons   in    the    nerve    ring,    such    as
            the   direct   connections    made    by    OLL    onto    SMD    or    the    connections    made    to    SMD    and    SMB
            by   OLQ   and   CEP   indirectly   via   RIC.   Most   of   the   putative   sensory   receptors   are    not    exclusively
            postsynaptic   but   receive    synaptic    input    primarily    from    other    sensory    receptors;    however,    these
            receptor-receptor     connections     are     not     as     prominent     as     receptor-interneuron      or      receptor-
            motoneuron    connections.    The    only    receptors    with    a    "Well    characterized    sensory     modality     are
            the    touch    receptors    ALM,    PLM    and    AVM    (Chalfie    &    Sulston    1981).     ALM     and     AVM     have
            long,  differentiated   processes   that   run   in   the   anterior   regions   of   the   body,   whereas   the   processes
            of   PLM   span   the   posterior    regions.    Stimulation    of    the    anterior    neurons,    by    gently    stroking
            animals   with   a    fine    hair,    causes    animals    to    move    backwards;    stimulation    of    the    posterior
            neurons   causes   the   animals    to    move    forwards.    Laser    ablation    studies    have    shown    that    these
            responses    are    primarily    mediated    by    the    connections    made    to     AVA,     AVD,     PVC     and     AVB
            (Chalfie et al. 1984).

            Motoneurons in the nerve ring (figure 21 c)

              Two    prominent    motoneuron    classes,    RMD     and     SMD,     are     probable     cross-inhibitors     in     the
            nerve   ring.   RMD   receives   extensive   synaptic   input   from    most    of    the    motoneurons    of    the    ring
            (including itself) at dyadic NMJs. Each of the SMD neurons has only one dendritic process

            54                                     J.G. WHITE AND OTHERS

            that  enters  the   NMJ   region   of   the   ring;   this   is   postsynaptic   to   RME   and   the   contralateral   SMD.
            The    dorsal     and     ventral     RMEs     (RMED     and     RMEV)     have     dendritic     processes     that     are
            postsynaptic   at   the   NMJs   made   by    SMB.    The    lateral    RMEs    have    no    such    processes,    however,
            and so it is not clear whether this class should be considered to be a cross-inhibitor.
              The    putative    cross-inhibitors    of    the    nerve    ring     receive     extensive     synaptic     input     from
            interneurons.   This   is    quite    unlike    their    counterparts    in    the    ventral    cord    (DDn    and    VDn),
            which    are    only    postsynaptic    to    ventral    cord    motoneurons    at    NMJs.     The     RIP     interneurons,
            which    provide    the    only    connection    between    the    central    nervous    system    and     the     pharyngeal
            nervous   system,   have   several   of   the   features   of   cross-inhibitor   motoneurons;    they    are    postsynaptic
            at   the   NMJs   made   by   the   receptors   IL1   and   URA,   and   have    axonal    processes    that    cross    over
            to   the   contralateral   side.   It   seems   likely   that   they   may   act   to   inhibit   pharyngeal    pumping    on
            receipt of an appropriate stimulus from IL1, URA or IL2.
              The    major    source    of    synaptic    input    to    the    RMD    and     SMD     cross-inhibitors     comes     via
            extensive    synapses    from     RIA     interneurons.     These     connections     are     reciprocal;     the     reverse
            connections   are    quite    significant    although    not    as    numerous    as    the    forward    connections.    RIA
            is   one   of   the   most   prominent   interneurons   in   the    nerve    ring    and    receives    extensive    synaptic
            input    from    the    RIB    interneurons,    neurons    associated    with    the    amphid     sensilla     and     other
            putative   sensory   receptors   with   no   obvious   modality.   RIB   is   also   a    fairly    prominent    interneuron,
            which makes synaptic connections with diverse partners.
              The   putative    receptors    IL1    and    URA    are    both    fairly    prominent    motoneurons    in    the    nerve
            ring.    They    behave    as    other    motoneurons,    and    make    quite    extensive    NMJs,    which    are     also
            presynaptic    to    cross-inhibitor    neurons.    They    also    receive    synaptic    input    from    other    putative
            receptor   neurons,   notably   IL2   and   CEP.   The   IL2   receptors   share   the    same    inner    labial    sensilla
            as  the   IL1   receptors   or   motoneurons,   but   unlike   the   IL1   receptors   they   are   open   to   the   outside
            and so are probably chemoreceptive.
              The   SAA    interneurons    have    long,    anteriorly    directed,    undifferentiated    processes    that    run    in
            the   sub-lateral   cords.   These   processes    could    possibly    act    as    stretch    receptors    monitoring    the
            posture  of  the  tip  of   the   head.   The   main   synaptic   output   of   SAA   is   directed   to   the   major   ring
            motoneurons,   RIM,   and   the   ventral    cord    interneurons,    AVA.    There    is    synaptic    input    from    the
            SMB    motoneurons    and    the    VB1    ventral    cord    motoneurons.    Thus    SAA    interacts    with    the    body
            and   the   head   motor   systems   and,   given   its   possible    head-posture    transducing    function,    it    seems
            likely    that    these    interneurons    could    function    to;    couple    and     coordinate     head     and     body
            movements.    Such    coupling    seems    to    occur     during     forward     locomotion,     as     there     are     no
            discontinuities between head and body movements in this situation.

             Motoneurons of the ventral cord (figure 21 d)

               The   ventral   and   dorsal   body   muscles   are   innervated   by    their    own    sets    of    motoneurons.    Both
             sets  of  motoneurons  have  cell   bodies   that   reside   in   the   ventral   cord   (figure   4)   and   receive   their
             synaptic   inputs   from   interneurons   that   have   processes   that   run    along    the    cord.    The    motoneurons
             that  innervate  dorsal  muscles   have   axons   that   run   in   the   dorsal   cord   and   join   up   to   their   cell
             bodies in the ventral cord via circumferential commissures (figure 7).
              There   are   four   classes    of    motoneuron    that    innervate    ventral    muscles    (VAn,    VBn,    VDn,    and
            VCn),   and   four   that   innervate   dorsal   muscles   (DAn,    DBn,    DDn    and    ASn).    Of    these,    the    VAn
            and   DAn   classes   are   similar   and   should   probably   be   considered   to   be   the   same   class,    as    both
            have forward-directed axons and both have the same pattern of synaptic input from

                   THE MIND OF A WORM                                                                                                                        55

            interneurons   in   the   cord.   In   an    analogous    way,    VBn    and    DBn    should    probably    be    considered
            as  one  class,   as   again   both   have   the   same   pattern   of   synaptic   input   and   the   same   direction   of
            axon  projection,   only   in   this   case   they   are   posteriorly   directed.   All   four   of   these   classes   have
            long,   undifferentiated   distal   regions   on   their   axons,   in   contrast   to   the    processes    of    VDn    and
            DDn   motoneurons,   which   end   abruptly   at   the   point   of   contact   with   the    process    of    an    adjacent
            neuron of the same class.
              The    VDn    and    DDn     motoneurons     receive     their     synaptic     input     solely     from     the     other
            motoneuron   classes   on   one   side   of   the   animal,   usually    at    dyadic    NMJs,    and    have    their    own
            NMJs   on   the   opposite   side.   On   the   dorsal   side,   DDn   has    NMJs    and    VDn    is    postsynaptic;    on
            the   ventral   side,   VDn    has    NMJs    and    DDn    is    postsynaptic.    The    VDn    and    DDn    could    again
            be  considered   as   a   single   class;   the   disposition   of   their   processes   and   axons   suggests   that   they
            probably   are   cross-inhibitors.   The   DDn   neurons   have    been    shown    to    rewire    in    the    course    of
            larval  development   (White   et   al.   1978).   In   the   L1   (first   stage)   larva   their   polarity   is   reversed
            from   that   of   the   adult,   having   NMJs   on   the   ventral   side   and   being    postsynaptic    to    DAn    and
            DBn   motoneurons   on   the   dorsal   side.   The   DAn,   DBn,    SAB    and    DDn    are    the    only    classes    of
            motoneuron    present    in    the    L1    ventral    cord;     the     other     classes     develop     post-embryonically
            (Sulston & Horvitz 1977).
              The  SAB  neurons  have   no   synaptic   outputs   in   the   adult   and   L4   larval   stages,   but   in   the   first
            stage   (L1)   larva   the   three   neurons   of   this   class   innervate   anterior   ventral   body   muscles   (SAB-b).
            The   only   other   motoneurons   that   are   seen   to   innervate   ventral   body   muscles   at    this    stage    are
            the    putative    cross-inhibitors    DDn.    This     perhaps     suggests     that     the     SAB     motoneurons     may
            provide   some   excitatory   inputs   to   the   ventral   body   muscles   during   this    stage.    In    several    ways
            SAB    neurons    resemble    VAn-DAn    neurons.    They    have    the    same    pattern    of    synaptic    input     as
            these   classes   and   also   have    long    undifferentiated    distal    endings    to    their    anteriorly    directed
            processes.   These   processes   run   in   the   sub-lateral   cords,   unlike   the   distal    processes    of    VAn-DAn,
            which run ventrally.
              The   two   remaining   classes,   ASn   and    VCn,    are    quite    distinct    and    are    less    prominent    with
            respect   to   their    innervation    of    body    muscles    than    the    other    classes.    The    ASn    motoneurons
            innervate    dorsal    muscles    and    are    somewhat    similar    to    DAn    motoneurons     in     morphology     and
            synaptic    input.    The    VCn     motoneurons     are     primarily     motoneurons     for     the     vulval     muscles
            (figure 11), but also innervate ventral body muscles.
              There   are   five   main   classes   of    interneuron    that    provide    synaptic    input    to    the    motoneurons
            of   the   ventral   cord:   AVA,   AVB,   AVD,   AVE   and   PVC.   All    have    cell    bodies    anteriorly    in    the
            lateral  ganglia,  except  for  PVC,  which  has   its   cell   bodies   in   the   lumbar   ganglia   in   the   tail.   The
            classes   AVD    and    AVE    have    identical    patterns    of    synaptic    output    although    they    have    quite
            different   patterns   of   synaptic   input.   The   processes    of    AVE    terminate    in    the    mid-body    region,
            whereas   the   processes   of   all   the   other   interneuron   classes   run   the   whole   length   of   the    ventral
            nerve    cord.    AVA,    AVD    and     AVE     make     chemical     synapses     onto     the     VAn-DAn     motoneurons;
            AVA   also   makes   gap   junctions   to   them.   The   dorsal   motoneuron   class,   ASn,    has    all    the    classes
            of    synaptic    partner    that    VAn-DAn    motoneurons    have,    and    indeed    makes     gap     junctions     with
            them, but it receives an additional chemical synapse from AVB.
              The    VBn-DBn    motoneurons    are     predominantly     innervated     by     gap     junctions     from     AVB     and
            chemical   synapses   from   PVC    together    with    a    few    chemical    synapses    from    DVA.    Laser    ablation
            experiments    have    demonstrated    that,    in    the    first    stage    larva,     the     DBn     motoneurons     are
            necessary for forward locomotion (backward-propagating body waves), and the DAn moto-

            56                                     J.G. WHITE AND OTHERS

            neurons     are     necessary     for     backward     locomotion     (forward-propagating     body     waves)      (Chalfie
            et  al.  1984).  Because  of  their   similar   structure   and   identical   patterns   of   synaptic   input,   it   seems
            likely    that    VAn    motoneurons    have    similar    functions    to    DAn    motoneurons,    and    likewise     VBn
            motoneurons    have    similar    functions    to    DBn    motoneurons.    Considering    the    sources    of     synaptic
            input   to   these   classes   of   motoneuron,   it   seems   likely   that   the    AVB-PVC    interneurons    are    used
            for     forward      movement      and      the      AVA-AVD-AVE      interneurons      are      used      for      backward
            movement. There is some evidence for this from laser ablation studies (Chalfie et al. 1984).

             Circuitry associated with neurons in the tail (figure 21 e)

              The  tail   region   of   C.   elegans   contains   a   number   of   classes   of   receptor   neuron,   interneuron   and
            motoneuron   that   are   specific   to   this   region.   Most   of   these   neurons    project    into    the    neuropile
            of   the   pre-anal   ganglion,   which   is   situated   at   the   posterior   extremity   of   the   ventral   cord.    In
            general,   synapses   made   by   neurons   in   the   tail   are   smaller   and   less    numerous    than    those    seen
            in   the   nerve   ring   or   anterior   ventral   cord.   Some   classes   of   neuron,    such    as    PVT,    PVW    and
            PDB,   make   very   few   synaptic   contacts.   The   major    interneurons    in    the    tail    circuitry    are    the
            ventral   cord   neurons,   AVA,   AVD    and    PVC,    and    two    interneuron    classes    with    cell    bodies    in
            the tail, DVA and LUA.
               The   tail   has   two   pairs   of   sensilla,   the   phasmids   and   the   posterior   deirids.   The   phasmids    are
             probably    chemosensory,    as    their    component    neurons    are    open    to    the    outside    in    a    similar
             arrangement   to   the   neurons   of   the   amphid   sensilla.   There    are    two    neurons    in    each    sensillum,
             PHA   and   PHB.   PHA   is   unusual;   virtually   all   its   synaptic    output    is    directed    onto    the    other
             phasmid neuron, PHB. This in turn synapses mainly onto AVA and PVC.
               The   posterior   deirid   sensilla   are   similar   in   structure   to   the   anterior   deirids,   and    both    have
             been   shown   to   contain   the    neurotransmitter    dopamine    (Sulston    et    al.    1975).    The    cell    bodies
             of  the  single   receptor   neuron   (PDE)   and   the   accessory   cells   of   the   sensilla   are   situated   in   the
             lateral,   mid-posterior   regions   of   the   body.   The   synaptic   output   of   PDE   is    quite    different    from
             that   of   the   anterior   deirid   receptor   neuron,   ADE;   its    main    postsynaptic    partner    is    DVA.    The
             putative   receptor   neuron   PVM   has   a   cell   body   in   the   right-hand    posterior    lateral    ganglion    and
             has   a   differentiated   ultrastructure   that   is   very   similar   to   that   of   the   anterior    touch    receptor
             neuron,   AVM   (Chalfie   &   Sulston   1981).   Its    synaptic    output    is    quite    different    from    that    of
             AVM,   however,   being   directed   mainly   to   PDE.   This    neuron    does    not    seem    to    be    involved    in
             the touch response (Chalfie et al. 1984) as is AVM.
               The   posterior   body   of   the   hermaphrodite   tapers   down   into   a   long   thin   tailspike.    Seven    classes
             of   neuron   have   long,   undifferentiated   processes   that   run   nearly   to    the    end    of    this    tailspike
             (AVG,   ALN,   PLN,   PHC,   PVR,   PLM   and    PDB).    It    seems    likely    that    these    neurons    are    sensory
             and  that  the  tailspike  is,  in  fact,  a  large   sense   organ,   although   it   does   not   have   the   sheath   and
             socket   cells   that   are   components   of   sensilla.   The   neurons   of   the   tailspike   are   quite   diverse   in
             their    synaptic    connections.    PHC    has    short    processes     and     synapses     predominantly     onto     DVA
             and   PVC;   PVR   has   a   process   that   traverses   the   length   of   the   ventral   cord    and    synapses    onto
             AVB  and  RIP  in  the  nerve  ring.   AVG   is   the   only   tailspike   class   that   does   not   have   a   posteriorly
             located  cell  body;  it  has  a  single,   rather   large   cell   body   in   the   retrovesicular   ganglion.   The   main
             synaptic   output   of   AVG   seems   to   be   via   extensive   gap   junctions    to    the    two    RIF    interneurons
             also situated in the retrovesicular ganglion.
               The   other   classes   of   neuron   with   processes    in    the    tailspike,    ALN,    PLN    and    PLM,    probably
             have a sensory function in other regions as well as in the tailspike. PLM are the posterior touch

           neurons and span the whole of the  posterior  region  of  the  body.  ALN  and  PLN  are  two  classes
           that have processes that run alongside, and are  closely  associated  with,  the  transducing  regions
           of the processes of ALM and  PLM  respectively.  They  project  into  the  nerve  ring  and  it  seems
           probable that they are also involved with the touch system in some way.
             The motoneuron PDB has a proximal process  that  runs  into  and  out  of  the  tailspike  en  route
           from the ventral to the dorsal cord.  No  synaptic  input  is  seen  onto  this  neuron;  however,  it
           makes  a  few  NMJs  onto  dorsal  body  muscles.  It  is  possible  that,  in   contrast   to   other
           motoneurons  with  long  distal  processes,  the  long  proximal  process  of  PDB   may   have   some
           transducing function in  the  tailspike.  PDA  is  another  single  motoneuron  like  PDB;  both  have
           cell bodies situated in the pre-anal ganglion. PDA  also  innervates  dorsal  muscles  but  sends  its
           process to the dorsal cord by  a  more  direct  route  via  a  lumbar  commissure.  It  receives  some
           synaptic  input  from   the   interneuron/motoneuron   DVB.   The   only   synaptic   input   to   the
           defecation  muscles  is  provided  by  DVB,  which   therefore   (presumably)   controls   defecation.
           PDA may mediate the  contractions  of  the  posterior  body,  which  are  associated  with  defecation
           (Crofton 1966), via its connection with DVB.
             The  ventral  cord  motoneurons,  DA8,  DA9   and   VA12,   have   rather   different   patterns   of
           synaptic connections from the more anterior members  of  their  classes.  Although  they  still  retain
           the synaptic inputs from  AVA  and  AVD  that  are  characteristic  of  these  classes,  DA9,  DA8  and
           VA12  have  several  additional  sources  of  synaptic   input:   VA12   from   PHC;   DA9   from   PHC
           and  PHB;  and  DA8  from  DVB.  In  addition   VA12   synapses   onto   DBT,   DA8   and   DA9.   None
           of  the  other  VAn  motoneurons  is  seen  to  synapse  convincingly  onto  other  motoneuron  classes
           except  VDn  and  DDn,  and  so  this  feature  is  probably  indicative  of  an  intrinsic  difference
           between  VA12  and  the  other  VAns.  The  synaptic  inputs  from  PHC   and   PHB,   on   the   other
           hand, may be  restricted  to  the  posterior  members  of  the  VAn  and  DAn  classes  simply  because
           of  the  limited  extent  of  the  axons  of  PHB  and  PHC  in  the  ventral  cord.  This  would   not
           necessarily  require  an  intrinsic  difference  in  DA8,  DA9  and  VA12  compared  with   the   other
           members of their class.

            The egg-laying circuitry (figure 21f)

             The vulval  and  uterine  muscles  are  predominantly  innervated  by  two  classes  of  motoneuron,
           HSN  and  VCn.  The  VCn  motoneuron  class  has  six  members,  which  are  distributed   along   the
           central regions of the ventral cord. They  synapse  onto  ventral  body  muscles  as  well  as  vulval
           muscles. The only significant synaptic  input  that  was  seen  on  to  them  comes  from  HSN.  These
           synapses  are  in  close  proximity  to  the  NMJs  made  by  the  VCns  onto  the  vulval   muscles,
           suggesting that they could perhaps  be  mediating  a  presynaptic  inhibition  of  the  VCns.  Various
           pharmacological   agents,   including   acetylcholine   agonists,   serotonin   analogues    and    an
           octopamine blocking agent, have been shown to stimulate egg laying (Horvitz et al. 1984).
             Laser  ablation  experiments  have  shown  that  the  HSN  neurons  are  essential  for  egg  laying
           (Trent et al. 1983). The circuitry associated with  HSN  is  rather  ambiguous.  It  is  predominantly
           presynaptic  and  only  receives  a  few  synapses  back  from  its  postsynaptic  partner,  BDU,  and
           a single synapse  from  each  PLM.  This  type  of  behaviour  suggests  that  HSN  is  not  simply  a
           motoneuron but  may  have  some  sensory  transduction  function  that  provides  the  primary  signal
           for the activation of the vulval muscles. There is, however,  no  obvious  feature  of  its  structure
           which suggests such a function.
             The same arguments can be applied to the VCn neurons because of their apparent lack of

           58                                    J.G. WHITE AND OTHERS

           presynaptic   partners,   although   it   is   not   yet    known    whether    the    VCns    are    essential    for    egg
           laying.   Another    possibility    is    that    the    main    inputs    for    HSN    and    VCn    come    via    humoral
           neurotransmitters   rather    than    by    focal    synaptic    contacts.    The    sensory    integration    required    to
           determine   the   appropriate   moment   for   egg   laying   could    then    be    executed    in    other    regions    of
           the    nervous    system,    with    no    morphologically    distinguishable    connections    being     made     to     the
           vulval muscle motoneurons.

                                   CONCLUSIONS

              There    are,    perhaps,    two    fundamental    questions    in    the    field    of    neurobiology:    how    neurons
            organize     themselves     during     development     into     specifically     interconnected     networks,     and     how
            such   a   network   functions.   A   knowledge   of   the   detailed   structure   of   a    nematode's    nervous    system
            does  not  in  itself  provide  any  answers  to  these   questions,   but   it   does   at   least   provide   a   framework
            within which it is possible to pose rather more specific questions.
              The   development   of   a   nervous   system   can   be    divided    into    three    separate    phases.    The    first
            is  the   generation   of   a   group   of   differentiated   neurons;   the   second   is   the   outgrowth   and   guidance
            of   processes   from   these    neurons    and    the    third    is    the    establishment    of    connections    between
            processes.    The    structural    data    on    the    nervous    system    provides    information     that     is     most
            pertinent   to   the   last   two   phases.   This   is   because   the   final    structure    represents    the    ultimate
            consequences   of   the   execution   of   these   two   processes.   We   will   go   on   to   discuss   how   these    two
            developmental   processes,   together   with   the   question    of    nervous    system    function,    may    be    further
            explored in C. elegans.

                                   Process  placement

              One  of  the  most  striking  features  of  the  nervous   system   of   C.   elegans   is   the   precision   with   which
            processes   are   positioned   relative    to    their    neighbours    within    process    bundles.    Synaptic    contacts
            are   made   en   passant   between   adjacent   processes;   the   set   of    possible    synaptic    partners    that    a
            neurone   may   have   is   therefore   limited   to   the   set   of   processes   that   are    neighbours.    Given    the
            unbranched  nature  of   nematode   neurons,   this   set   is   usually   a   relatively   small   subset   of   the   total
            complement   of    neurons    that    make    up    the    nervous    system.    Within    this    neighbourhood,    however,
            neurons   are    fairly    highly    connected,    making    connections    to    nearly    half    their    neighbours    on
            average   (White   et   al.   1983).   Furthermore,   there   is    circumstantial    evidence    that    this    level    of
            connectivity    may    be    independent    of    neighbourhood,    i.e.     that     a     given     neuron     may     make
            synaptic   connections   to   more   or   less   the   same   percentage   of   its   neighbours   no   matter   what   class
            they   may   be   (White   et   al.   1983).   Thus   process   placement   must   be   a   major    determinant    in    the
            establishment of the patterns of connectivity within the nervous system of C. elegans.
              It   seems   likely   that   there   may   be   two   aspects    of    process    placement:    substrate    guidance    of
            pioneering   processes   to   establish   process    tracts    (Berlot    &    Goodman    1984),    and    the    positioning
            of    processes    relative    to    their    neighbours    within    bundles    once    process    tracts    have     become
            established.   A   distinctive   feature   of   the   organization   of   processes   within    bundles    is    the    close
            associations   that   are   seen   between   specific   processes,   or   between   a   process   and   the   basal   lamina.
            Such    associations    are    probably    the    consequence    of    selective    adhesive    affinities    between     the
            associating    entities.    Given    the    probable    importance     of     selective     adhesivity     in     determining
            connectivity,   it   is   worth   considering,   within   the   context   of   the    nematode's    nervous    system,    how
            such phenomena may be further investigated.

                   THE MIND OF A WORM                                                                                                  59

              Many behavioural mutants have been  isolated  in  C.  elegans;  it  is  likely  that  most  of  their
            phenotypes are the consequence of alterations in the nervous  system.  It  is  also  likely  that  some
            of these  alterations  could  take  the  form  of  misplaced  processes.  Up  to  now,  relatively  few
            behavioural  mutants  have  been  analysed  at  the  ultrastructural  level.  This  is  mainly  because
            of the considerable effort that is required  to  reconstruct  a  significant  portion  of  the  nervous
            system  from  electron  micrographs.  Recently,  staining   techniques   have   been   developed   that
            allow the visualization of specific processes  or  process  bundles  in  whole  mounts  of  C.  elegans
            when viewed with the light  microscope.  In  one  of  these  techniques,  sensory  process  tracts  are
            labelled by dye filling (Hedgecock et al. 1984).  In  another,  processes  of  certain  neuron  classes
            are  labelled  with  monoclonal  antibodies  and  viewed  by   immunofluorescence   in   whole   mounts
            (Okamoto  &  Thomson  1984).  Such  techniques  will  facilitate  the  pre-screening   of   behavioural
            mutants  for  those  that  have  abnormalities  in  process  placement.  Selected  mutants   may   then
            be subjected to a full ultrastructural analysis.
              With  the  dye  uptake   technique,   certain   mutants   have   been   found   to   have   abnormal
            projections from sensory  receptors  (Hedgecock  et  al.  1984);  such  mutants  could  be  candidates
            for substrate guidance. The defects  in  these  mutants  could  either  be  located  in  the  neurons,
            or in the substrate upon which they grow.  It  may  be  possible  to  distinguish  between  these  two
            possibilities by means of mosaic analysis (Herman 1984).
              Of the  mutants  that  have  been  analysed  by  serial  section  reconstruction,  one  (unc-30)  has
            been found to  have  misplaced  processes  on  the  VDn  and  DDn  motoneuron  classes  (J.  G.  White,
            S.  Brenner  &  R.  Durbin,  unpublished  observations).  The  disposition  of  the  processes  of  the
            other motoneuron  classes  in  the  ventral  cord  appears  normal.  It  seems  possible  that  such  a
            mutant could be defective in the  class-specific  expression  of  an  adhesion  factor.  The  molecular
            analysis of genes that affect process placement may  provide  a  route  to  an  eventual  understanding
            of  the  function  and  deployment  of  region-specific  adhesion  molecules.  Another  route  to   the
            same  end  may  be  taken  by   directly   looking   for   putative   adhesion   molecules.   Candidate
            molecules would be expected to  be  common  to  a  group  of  processes  that  are  closely  associated
            together. Such a molecule could be sought  either  directly  by  using  antibodies,  or  indirectly  by
            looking for species of messenger RNA that show the appropriate neuronal distribution.

                                    Synaptic specificity

              Although  we  have  played  down  the  role  of  synaptic  specificity  in  the  generation  of   the
            pattern of connections within the nervous system of C. elegans to a certain extent, it  is  clear  that
            there has to be some level of  specificity.  On  average,  a  neuron  is  presynaptic  to  about  15  %
            of  its  neighbours  (unpublished  observations).  The  subset  of  neighbours  that  are  postsynaptic
            to a  given  neuron  is  fairly  constant  from  animal  to  animal,  and  so  is  presumably  actively
            selected. It is likely that synaptogenesis is initiated by  a  cell-cell  recognition  event.  Such  an
            event may involve the binding of a surface  receptor  molecule  on  one  cell  to  a  matching  'label'
            molecule on another cell. If all cell classes had  single  distinguishing  label  and  receptor  types,
            then the set of synaptic partners of a given cell class could never intersect  with  that  of  another.
            Such intersections are, in fact, the  general  rule  in  the  nervous  system.  Therefore,  if  such  a
            label-receptor system is the basis of synaptic specificity, then the  labels  (and/or  receptors)  have
            to be arranged combinatorially.
              It  is  probably  not  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  pattern  of   connections   seen   between
            processes in a particular neighbourhood is solely the consequence of the intrinsic specificities

            of   the   neurons   involved.   There   are   suggestions    that    interactions    between    synapses    may    act    to
            modify   certain   patterns   of   synaptic   connection   that    might    otherwise    form    as    a    consequence    of
            specific    neuron-neuron    recognition.    There    are    slight    differences    in     connectivity     between     the
            dorsal   and   ventral   members    of    the    classes    SMB,    SAA,    OLQ    and    RMD.    These    differences    are
            manifested    as    reciprocal    substitutions    of    gap    junctions    for    chemical    synapses     and     chemical
            synapses   for    gap    junctions.    This    behaviour    may    suggest    that    there    are    interactions    between
            these   types   of   connection   in   these   circumstances,   and   that   these   interactions   result   in   a    mutual
            exclusivity of chemical synapses and gap junctions.
              We   have   used   the   criteria   of   morphology   and   connectivity   to   define   the   118   classes   of    neuron
            that   have   been   described.   Given   that   a   particular   neuron   can   only   select   synaptic    partners    from
            its  neighbourhood,  it  is   probable   that   there   are   classes   that   we   have   defined   that   have   the   same
            intrinsic   synaptic   potential;   in   other   words,   if    placed    in    the    same    neighbourhood    they    would
            select   the   same   subset   of   neighbours   as   synaptic   partners.   Therefore,   the   number   of   classes    that
            we   have   defined   (118)   is   almost   certainly   an   overestimate   of   the   number   of    neuron    types    that
            are   intrinsically   different   in   their   specificities.   It   is    strongly    suspected,    on    the    basis    of
            morphology,   that   AQR   and   PQR   are   members    of    a    single    class,    as    are    ALM    and    PLM,    ALN
            and   PLN,   and   AVM   and   PVM.   It   is   probable   that   there   are   other    class    equivalences    that    are
            not   so   obvious,   particularly    among    the    interneurons,    which    often    do    not    have    distinguishably
            different   morphologies.   It   may   be    possible    to    identify    such    'superclasses'    by    a    neighbourhood
            analysis.    If    the    neighbourhoods    from    two    classes    are    compared    and    common     neighbours     are
            identified,  then  it  is  possible  that  the  two  classes   may   be   members   of   a   superclass,   if   the   pattern
            of    synaptic    connections    made    to    the    common    neighbours    is    the    same    in    each    case.     By
            considering   all   pairwise    combinations    of    classes,    and    then    reiterating    the    process    considering
            all   members   of   putative   superclasses   as   equivalent,   it   may   be   possible   to   arrive   at   a   logically
            consistent  set  of  superclasses.   These   superclasses   will   define   groups   of   cells   that   have   intrinsically
            identical   synaptic   specificities.   Such   an   endeavour   may   not   just   be   an   idle   intellectual    exercise,
            as   a   knowledge   of   such   'supergroups'   could   facilitate    the    identification    of    mutants    that    have
            altered   labels   or   receptors.   Such   mutations   would    be    expected    to    have    pleiotropic    consequences,
            affecting   all   the   members   of   a   supergroup.   Thus   mutants    that    affect    connectivity    of    all    the
            members    of    a    particular    supergroup    are    candidates    for    mutants    with    altered    labels     and/or
            receptors.   An   analysis   of   such   mutants   may    provide    a    possible    route    towards    an    understanding
            of the molecular basis of synaptic specificity.

                                  Nervous system function

               The  relative  simplicity  of  the   structure   of   the   nervous   system   of   C.   elegans   provides   a   challenge
             to   determine   how   it   functions.   The   main   disadvantage    of    this    nervous    system    from    the    point
             of  view  of   functional   studies   is   that   the   small   size   of   the   component   neurons   precludes   the   use
             of    electrophysiological    recording    techniques.     Such     techniques     can,     however,     be     used     with
             Ascaris.    There    are    considerable    homologies    between    the    ventral    cord    motoneurons     of     Ascaris
             and   C.   elegans   (Stretton   et   al.   1978);   more   recently,   similar   homologies   have   been   seen   in    the
             interneurons     of     the     retro-vesicular     ganglion     (Donmoyer,     Angstadt     and      Stretton,      personal
             communication).    The    neurotransmitter    dopamine    has    been    shown    to    be    present     in     the     same
             classes  of  cells  in  the  two  animals  (Sulston  et   al.   1975)-   It   seems   likely   that   such   structural   and
             biochemical     similarities     may     indicate     an     underlying     functional     similarity,     justifying     the
             extrapolation   of   data   obtained    from    one    animal    to    the    other.    Electrophysiological    studies    on
             homologous cells in Ascaris suggest that the DAn, DBn, and ASn motoneurons of C. elegans are

                                                   THE MIND OF A WORM                                                              61

           excitatory,   whereas    the    DDn    and    VDn    motoneurons    are    inhibitory    (Johnson    &    Stretton    1980).
           Further   work   may   yield   information   about   the   role   of   the   interneurons   of   the   ventral    cord    in
           activating the motoneurons.
             The   functional   aspects   of   the   nervous    system    of    C.    elegans    may    be    studied    directly    by
           characterizing   the   behavioural   consequences    of    specific    lesions    in    the    nervous    system.    Lesions
           may   be   produced   by   laser   microsurgery   (Sulston   &    White    1980),    a    technique    that    is    capable
           of  removing  any   cell   or   small   group   of   cells   within   the   nervous   system.   As   an   alternative,   use
           may   be   made   of   lesions   produced    as    a    consequence    of    mutations.    For    example,    one    mutant,
           unc-80,   specifically   affects   the   organization   of   the    VDn    and    DDn    motoneurons    in    the    ventral
           cord,   leaving   the   other   motoneuron   classes   relatively    unaffected    (J.    G.    White,    S.    Brenner    &
           R.    Durbin,    unpublished    observations).    This    mutant    is    uncoordinated    in    forward    and     backward
           locomotion.   When   stimulated   by   a   tap   on    the    head,    instead    of    backing    away,    these    animals
           shorten    by    simultaneously    activating    both    their    ventral     and     their     dorsal     muscles.     This
           behaviour   is   what   one   would   predict   if   cross-inhibition    between    the    dorsal    and    ventral    sides
           were    lacking.    This    observation    reinforces    the    suggestion,     originally     made     on     morphological
           criteria, that the VDn and DDn classes function as cross-inhibitors.
             The    combined    techniques    of    laser    microsurgery,    mutants    and    tests    for     drug     responsiveness
           have   been   used   to   produce   detailed   models   for   the   function   of   the   circuitry   associated   with   the
           touch   response   (Chalfie   et   al.   1984),   and   the   circuitry   that   controls   egg-laying   (Horvitz   et    al.
           1984).   Other   areas   of   the    nervous    system    should    be    equally    amenable    to    such    methodologies,
           particularly   the   chemosensory   system.   This    system    is    particularly    attractive,    as    the    chemotactic
           response    has    been    characterized    (Ward    1973;    Dusenbery    1974)    and     many     mutants     that     are
           defective in chemotaxis have been isolated (Dusenbery et al. 1975; Lewis & Hodgkin 1977).

             We   would    like    to    thank    our    colleagues    who,    over    the    years,    have    offered    advice    and
           encouragement   for    this    work.    We    would    particularly    like    to    mention    Donna    Albertson,    Martin
           Chalfie,    Richard    Durbin,    Edward    Hedgecock,    Robert    Horvitz    and    John    Sulston    for     the     many
           stimulating   discussions    that    we    have    had    together,    and    also    Donna    Albertson,    Leon    Nawrocki
           and John Sulston for reading and commenting on the manuscript.

                           APPENDIX         l.         CONNECTIVITY          DATA

             In   this   section,   all   the    detailed    connectivity    data    for    each    of    the    neuron    classes    are    presented.
           The    neuron    classes    are    arranged    in     alphabetical     order;     the     data     for     each     class     are     fairly
           self-contained.     Some      classes      have      been      grouped      together      because      they      share      many      common
           features; PLM is listed with ALM, PLN with ALN, PVM with AVM and PQR with AQR.
             The     data     that     are     presented     were     derived     primarily     from     three     reconstructed      animals;      the
           N2T   series,    the    N2U    series    and    the    JSE    series.    Together    these    series    covered    the    whole    of    the
           animal   except   for    a    region    in    the    posterior    body    (figure    A    1).    This    region    was    covered    by    a
           partial    reconstruction    of    a    male     (N2Y     series).     Data     from     this     animal     provided     information     on
           the    neurons    of    the    posterior    lateral    ganglia    and    the    motoneurons    of    the     posterior     ventral     cord.
           The    neuropile    of    the    nerve    ring    and    anterior    ventral    cord    was    also     reconstructed     from     an     L4
           larva (JSH series, figure A 1). These data were mainly used as a check on the N2U

            reconstructions, which covered this region and are not shown, except in the case of RMF, where
            there was a significant difference between the two series.
              Neuron    topographies    are    shown     in     semidiagrammatic     form     for     simplicity     in     presentation.
            Processes  of  neurons  in  C.  elegans  have   few,   if   any,   branches   and   tend   to   run   in   parallel   process
            bundles.   It   is   therefore   possible    to    give    a    reasonably    accurate    impression    of    their    three-
            dimensional   structure   by   means   of   such   diagrams.   Neurons   that   inhabit   the   regions    of    the    nerve
            ring   and   anterior   ventral   cord   are   plotted   out   in   diagrams   on   templates   of   the   form   shown    in
            figure  A   2.   Similarly,   neurons   that   have   processes   in   the   posterior   ventral   cord   are   plotted   out
            in   diagrams   on   templates   of   the   form    shown    in    figure    A    3.    Additional    diagrams    show    the
            disposition  of  the  cell  bodies   and   processes   of   the   class   members   within   the   animal,   as   seen   from
            a   lateral   viewpoint.   The   nerve   ring   or   anterior   ventral   cord   diagrams    are    drawn    as    if    from
            a  dorsal  viewpoint  of  an  animal  in  which   the   nerve   ring   has   been   flattened   so   as   to   lie   in   the
            same   plane   as   the   ventral   cord.   The   diagrams   of   neurons   in   posterior   regions    are    again    drawn
            from   a   dorsal   viewpoint,   but   in   this   case   an   imaginary   cut   has   been    made    along    the    dorsal
            mid-line   and   the   animal   opened   out   fiat   so   that   the   ventral   mid-line   runs   along   the   centre   of
            the diagrams (figure A 3).
               Processes   that   run   in   the   regions   covered   by   these   types   of    diagram    have    been    drawn    out
             with   all   their   synaptic    connections    listed.    Synaptic    connections    mediated    by    chemical    synapses
             are depicted by arrows. The direction in which the arrow points relative to the process indicates

               posterior face of the nerve ring and the dorsal face of the ventral  cord  are  directed  out  of  the  page.  The  shaded
               region indicates the extent  of  the  neuropile  in  these  regions.  The  isthmus  of  the  pharynx  passes  through  the
               hole in the middle of the nerve ring. The disposition of the major process tracts  that  join  this  region  of  neuropile
               are shown.

               opening and flattening the animal. The outlines indicate  the  dispositions  of  the  process  tracts  and  ganglia.  The

            whether   the   process   is   presynaptic   or   postsynaptic   for   that   particular    contact.    Synaptic    contacts
            in  which  the  process  is   one   of   several   that   are   postsynaptic   to   a   single   presynaptic   element   are
            marked   with   an   asterisk.   All   possible   postsynaptic   partners    of    contacts    in    which    the    process
            is   presynaptic   are    shown.    Gap    junctions    only    appear    between    two    elements    and    are    marked
            with a T; no directionality is implied.
              Certain   synaptic   connections   have   additional   labels.   These   labels   refer   to    a    set    of    electron
            micrographs,    which    illustrate    these    connections.    Many    illustrations    were    taken    from    the    JSH
            series  because  of  the  better   quality   of   the   pictures   that   were   obtained   from   this   series.   Although
            the  diagrams   refer   to   connections   seen   in   the   other   series,   it   was   nevertheless   possible   to   use
            these   illustrations,   because   in   most   cases   synaptic   connections   equivalent    to    those    indicated    in
            the   diagrams   could   be   found   in   the   JSH   series.   References   to   illustrations   of   synaptic    contacts
            are  made  by  an  index  letter.  These   refer   to   the   set   of   illustrations   that   is   associated   with   the
            neuron  class  currently   under   discussion.   If   the   index   letter   is   preceded   by   an   asterisk   then   the
            index letter refers to the set of illustrations associated with the class being referenced.
              The   two   diagram   formats   described   above   do    not    cover    the    central    body    region,    particularly
            the  region  of   the   ventral   cord   in   which   there   are   many   synaptic   contacts.   Data   from   this   region
            are  presented   in   two   ways'   either   as   a   table   of   synaptic   contacts,   in   the   case   of   interneurons
            which   have   processes   that   enter   the    region,    or    as    individual    diagrams,    for    motoneurons    that
            are  totally   contained   within   the   region.   The   motoneurons   of   the   ventral   cord   have   up   to   thirteen
            members   in   each   of   the   classes,   compared   with   a   maximum   of   four   members    for    all    the    other
            neuron   classes   in   the   animal.   Only   one'   typical'   member   of   each   of   the   ventral   cord    motoneuron
            classes is plotted, together with any atypical members that there may be in the class.

              ADA  is  a  set  of  two  interneurons  with   cell   bodies   situated   laterally   at   the   level   of   the   second
            bulb  of   the   pharynx.   Processes   enter   the   neuropile   of   the   retro-vesicular   ganglion   via   the   deirid
            commissures   and   run   anteriorly   into   the   nerve   ring.   They   then   run   round    the    nerve    ring    and
            end  in  a  gap  junction   to   their   contralateral   partners   (b).   The   processes   of   ADA   are   rather   small
            and  run  near   the   centre   of   the   neuropile   of   the   ring,   adjacent   to   the   processes   of   AVA,   much
            of   the   time.   Synaptic   endings   are   generally   small   and   have   large   dark   vesicles   (a).    The    main
            synaptic  output  is   to   AVB   (a,   c),   with   a   few   synapses   also   being   made   to   AVJ   (c),   RIM,   SMD
            and RIP (a). There are gap junctions to itself (b), AVD (d), PVO. ASH and ADF.

              ADE  is   a   set   of   two   ciliated   neurons   with   endings   in   the   deirid   sensilla,   which   are   situated
            in  the  alae  on  the  lateral  lines.  The  cell  bodies  of  ADE  are  part  of  a   small   group   of   cells   situated
            laterally   behind   the   second   bulb    of    the    pharynx.    Processes    enter    the    retro-vesicular    ganglion
            via the deirid commissures and then run anteriorly in the ventral ganglion (e). Here they cross
              over to the contralateral side and run posteriorly    a    for a short distance before                   ending.
            the   synaptic   output   is   situated   in   this   region   and   is   predominantly   to   RIG    (a)    and    RIG    in
            association   with   AVA    (b)    although    there    is    usually    a    bias    towards    RIG    in    these    dyadic
            synapses.   The   process   to   the   ciliated   ending   has    a    branch,    which    enters    the    ring    neuropile
            laterally,   running   anteriorly   through   the   ring    neuropile    and    making    some    rather    small    synapses
            to   diverse   partners;   OLL,   RMD    (c),    CEP    and    FLP    are    the    most    prominent    synaptic    partners
            in   this    region.    ADE    receives    some    synaptic    input    from    BDU    (*b),    FLP    (*c),    AVM(*)    and
            IL2L/R.   It   has   gap   junctions   to    AVK    (d)    in    the    neuropile    of    the    ventral    ganglion.    ADE
            neurons have been shown to contain dopamine (Sulston et al. 1975)-

              ADF is a set  of  two  neurons  that  have  dual  ciliated  endings  in  the  amphid  sensillum.  The
            endings are in  the  amphid  channel,  which  is  open  to  the  outside  (figure  1).  Processes  from
            lateral cell  bodies  enter  the  ventral  cord  via  the  amphidial  commissures  and.turn  anteriorly
            to enter the nerve ring. The processes  of  ADF  run  near  the  outside  surface  and  posterior  face
            of the ring,  in  close  association  with  those  of  AIZ.  They  meet  at  the  dorsal  mid-line  and
            terminate; there is a gap junction at the point  of  contact  (b).  The  main  synaptic  output  is  to
            RIA  and  AIZ  (a);  there  are  also  synapses  to  SMB  (c),  AUA  and   RIR,   usually   in   dyadic
            combinations  with  RIA  or  AIZ.  AWB  synapses  onto  ADF  in  several  places  (d,  *a)  and   there
            are gap junctions to RIH, ADA and AIA.

                ADL is    a set of two neurons that have dual ciliated endings in the amphid sensillum. The
             endings   are   in   the   amphid   channel,   which   is   open   to   the   outside   (figure   1).   Cell    bodies    are
             situated  in  the  dorsal  regions  of   the   lateral   ganglia   and   have   processes   that   enter   the   nerve   ring
             laterally,   unlike   the   other   amphid    neurons,    which    enter    the    ventral    cord    via    the    amphidial
             commissures.   The   processes   split   as   they   enter   the   nerve    ring    and    one    process    runs    dorsally
             round  to  the   mid-line   on   the   posterior   face   of   the   nerve   ring,   where   it   meets   its   contralateral
             partner    and    terminates    with    a    gap    junction    (b).    The    other    process    runs     ventrally     and
             eventually   peters   out   in   the   ventral   ganglion.   The   general   disposition   of   the    processes    in    the
             nerve   ring   is   much   like   those   of   the   other   amphid   neurons   (such   as   ASK,    alongside    which    it
             runs   for   much   of   its   length)   yet   the   route   from   the   cell   body   is    completely    different.    The
             processes  are  large;  they  run  in   close   association   with   those   of   AIB   and   are   filled   with   vesicles,
             many    of    which    are    dark-cored    (a).    The    processes     are     predominantly     presynaptic,     synapsing
             mainly   onto   AIA   (a)   and   AIB   (c)   and   to   a   lesser   extent   onto   AVD,   AVB   and   AVA    (d).    There

              AFD  is   a   set   of   two   ciliated   neurons   that   are   part   of   the   amphid   sensillum.   The   endings   of
            AFD   have   numerous   villi,   which   poke   into   the   amphid   sheath   cells   (figure   1).    The    cell    bodies
            are   situated    in    the    lateral    ganglia;    processes    enter    the    ventral    cord    via    the    amphidial
            commissures   and   turn   anteriorly   to   enter   the   nerve   ring.   They   run   round   on   the   outside    surface
            and  the  posterior  face  of  the  nerve  ring   in   close   association   with   the   processes   of   AIY   until   they
            meet   at   the   dorsal   mid-line,   where   they   terminate.   There   is   a   gap   junction   at    the    point    of
            contact   (b).   The   only   synaptic   output   is   to   AIY   (a);    some    dark-cored    vesicles    are    seen    in
            presynaptic   terminals   (a).   There   are    synaptic    inputs    from    AIN    (c)    and    AWA    (d)    and    small
            gap junctions to AIB in the ventral ganglion.

               AIA is a set of  two  interneurons  with  cell  bodies  situated  in  the  ventral  ganglion.  Their
             processes run up the ventral cord, run round the nerve  ring  close  to  the  posterior  face  of  the
             neuropile  and  terminate  at  the  dorsal  mid-line  with  a  gap  junction  to  their  contralateral
             partners (b). The processes  of  AIA  run  in  close  association  with  the  proximal  regions of  the
             processes from AIB (a). AIA is one  of  the  main  classes  of  integrating  neuron  for  the  neurons
             of  the  amphid  sensilla,  receiving  synaptic  inputs  predominantly  from  ASK  (*a),   ASG   (*a),
             ASH  (*a),  ADL  (*a),  PVQ  (*a-*d),  AIM  (*a),  ASE   (*b),   AWC   (*c),   AIZ   and   ASI   (*a).
             Most of these synapses are dyadic; AIB is the  corecipient.  The  main  synaptic  output  is  to  AIB,
             often as a dyadic with RIF (a)  or  AWC  (b)  as  the  corecipient.  AIA  has  gap  junctions  to  ASI
             (c), AWA (d) and ADF.

               AIB  is  a  set  of  two  interneurons  with  cell   bodies   situated   in   the   lateral   ganglia;   it   is   one   of
             the   main   classes   of   integrating   neuron   for   the   receptors   of   the   amphid   sensilla.   Processes    enter
             the   ventral   cord   from   the   cell   bodies   via   the   amphid    commissures    and    project    anteriorly    into
             the   nerve   ring.   They   then   run   round   the   nerve   ring   close   to    the    posterior    face,    in    close
             association   with   the   processes   of   AIA.   When   they   reach   the   dorsal   midline,   at   the    point    where
             the  processes   of   AIA   terminate,   they   turn   and   run   anteriorly   for   about   2.5   !~m   at   right   angles
             to   the   orientation   of   the   neighbouring   processes   in   this   region   (b).   They   then   turn    again    and
             continue   running   round   the   ring,   but   now   in   close   association    with    the    proximal    processes    of
             RIM   near   the   anterior   surface   of   the   ring.   They   eventually   reenter   the   ventral   cord   and   finally
             end   in   the   region   of   the   ventral   ganglion.   AIB   is   presynaptic   only   on   these   distal   regions   of
             its processes; the predominant postsynaptic partners are RIM (a, c, d), AVB (c), RIB (a, g)

                            AIB                                                                                                                                                 81

            and  SAAD   (d).   Because   of   the   unusual   shift   of   position   that   occurs   on   the   dorsal   mid-line,   the
            distal   and   proximal   regions   of   AIB   reside   in   different   regions   of   the   ring    neuropile    and    the
            synaptic   inputs   are,   therefore,   different    for    these    two    regions.    The    proximal    regions    receive
            essentially   the   same   synaptic   input   as   AIA    (except    for    synapses    from    AIA),    with    AIB    being
            the    second    postsynaptic    element    in    dyadic    synapses.    Most    of    the    synapses    appear    to     be
            symmetrical,   although   some   have   a   bias   towards    AIA    (e).    The    main    synaptic    inputs    in    these
            proximal   regions   are   from    AIA    (*a,    *b),    ASE,    ADL    (*c),    ASH,    AWC    (*b),    ASG    (*b),    AIZ
            (*g),   ASK   (*d)    and    ASI.    The    main    synaptic    inputs    on    the    distal    branch    are    from    AIZ
            (*e,   *f),   DVB   (*a),   DVC   (*c),   RIM   (f),   RIB   and   FLP.   AIB   has    gap    junctions    to    DVB,    DVC,
            RIG (h), AFD, RIS and RIV (*h).

               AIM is a set of two interneurons with cell bodies in  the  ventral  ganglion  behind  the  excretory
             duct. Processes run anteriorly from the cell bodies, adjacent to the lateral surfaces of  the  ventral
             cord. On entering the  nerve  ring  they  move  round  to  the  inside  surface  until  they  reach  a
             sub-dorsal position, where they loop out  into  the  middle  of  the  neuropile  and  then  return  to
             the inner surface until  the  processes  meet  and  terminate  with  a  gap  junction  on  the  dorsal
             mid-line. The  main  synaptic  output  is  to  AIA,  usually  in  association  with  ASG  (a)  or  ASK
             as dyadic partners. Synapses are also made to AS.]  (b),  AVF,  the  cephalic  sheath  cells  (c)  and
             a few other minor partners. There  is  not  much  synaptic  input  except  for  a  few  synapses  from
             ASK (*c). There are gap  junctions  to  SIBD  (d)  (there  was  only  one  present  in  the  U  series
             but there is one on each side in the H series).

              AIN is a set of two interneurons  with  cell  bodies  situated  in  the  lateral  ganglia.  Processes
            project  anteriorly  and  enter  the  nerve  ring  sub-dorsally.  They  run  round  the  ring  to   the
            contralateral side on the outside  surface  and  then  enter  the  ventral  cord,  eventually  petering
            out in the region of  the  ventral  ganglion.  The  main  synaptic  output  is  to  AFl)  (a,  d),  BAG
            (b), RIB (c), and ASE (a). The cephalic  sheath  cells  may  also  be  receiving  synaptic  input  from
            AIN at dyadic synapses (b). AIN  has  no  significant  synaptic  inputs  but  has  gap  junctions  with
            ASG, AUA (*d) and itself.

               AIY is a set of two interneurons with cell bodies  situated  in  the  ventral  ganglion  behind  the
             excretory duct. AIY is one of the main  classes  of  integrating  neuron  for  the  receptors  of  the
             amphid sensilla. Processes run up the ventral  cord  from  the  cell  bodies,  forming  characteristic
             structures in the ventral region of the neuropile of the ventral  ganglion  (e).  The  processes  then
             run round the nerve ring in the  posterior  region  of  the  neuropile,  meeting  and  terminating  at
             the dorsal mid-line with  a  gap  junction  (b).  The  main  synaptic  output  from  AIY  is  to  AIZ,
             RIA and RIB. These synapses are mainly  in  the  region  of  the  ventral  ganglion  and  are  usually
             dyadic (a) or triadic (e). There are also a few  smaller  synapses  to  AIZ  laterally  in  the  nerve
             ring  (c).  Synaptic  input  is  predominantly  from  ASE  (*a),  AWC   (*c),   AFD   (*a)   and   AWA
             (*c). Gap junctions are made to RIM (d).
               Magnifications: (a, d) x 5~5500, (b, c, e) x 12750.

              AIZ is a set of two interneurons with cell bodies  situated  in  the  lateral  ganglia.  AIZ  is  one
            of the main classes of integrating neuron for the receptors of the  amphid  sensilla.  Processes  enter
            the ventral  cord  via  the  amphid  commissures  and  run  anteriorly  near  the  ventral  surface  of
            the neuropile. Most of the  synaptic  output  is  in  the  region  of  the  neuropile  of  the  ventral
            ganglion. The processes then enter  the  nerve  ring  and  run  round  it  in  close  association  with
            the processes of ADF  near  the  middle  of  the  neuropile.  They  move  slightly  anteriorly  on  the
            dorsal side of the nerve ring and meet and terminate  at  the  dorsal  mid-line  with  a  gap  junction
            between them (b). The main synaptic outputs are  to  RIA  (a,  c,  d),  SMB  (a,  c,  d),  AIB  (e,  f,
            g),  RIM  (e,  g),  AIY  (f)  and  AVE.  The  main  synaptic  inputs  are  from  ADF  (*a),  AWA  (*a),
            AIY  (*a,  *c,  *e),  RIR  (*c),  AWB  (*a),  RIH  (*a)  and  HSN  (*f).   Gap   junctions   are   made
            to ASH and ASG (h) near the amphid commissures.

             ALA is a single cell situated in the dorsal ganglion  just  behind  the  nerve  ring  (b).  A  short
           process enters the dorsal cord and then peters out.  Two  larger,  bilaterally  symmetrical  processes
           leave the cell body and run right and left round the ring,  leaving  it  laterally  and  running  down
           the length of the animal, adjacent  to  the  excretory  canal  and  alongside  the  processes  of  CAN
           and PVD. This group of three processes, which  run  in  close  association  to  the  excretory  canal,
           has not been followed completely along  the  length  of  the  animal  although  it  has  been  sampled
           in several places. No synapses have been seen  from  this  group  except  for  one  small  synapse  to
           the lateral hypodermis (CAN-c). Two of the three  processes  end  at  about  the  level  of  the  anus
           and one enters  the  lumbar  ganglion  and  synapses  onto  PVC  (d).  In  the  nerve  ring,  ALA  has
           a few synapses to AVE (a) and possibly CEPsh (a)  and  a  gap  junction  to  RID  (c)  in  the  dorsal
           cord.

                                  ALM     AND      PLM

           Members' ALML, ALMR; PLML, PLMR.
             ALM  and  PLM  are  two  sets  of  two  sensory  neurons  that  transduce  touch  stimuli   (Chalfie
           & Sulston 1981). Both ALM and PLM have long lateral processes, closely apposed to the

            94                                                ALM AND PLM

            cuticle, which contain large, darkly staining microtubules (g) (Chalfie & Thomson 1982).
            Microtubules with the same appearance are seen in AVM and PVM, which are also part of
            the touch-transducing system.

            ALM
              The   cell   bodies    of    ALM    are    situated    laterally    in    the    mid-body    (i).    Anteriorly    directed
            processes   leave   the   cell   bodies   and   run   near   the   dorsal   edge   of   the   lateral    hypodermal    ridges
            in   close   association   with   the   processes   of   ALN   (*d).   Each   process   sends    off    a    branch,    which
            enters   the   nerve   ring   sub-dorsally;   this   then   runs   ventrally    round    the    ring    near    the    inside
            surface,   ending   soon   after   it   meets   a   process   of   AVM.   The   processes   of    ALM    are    predominantly
            presynaptic   in   the   nerve   ring   and   synapse   onto   BDU   (a),    PVC    (b)    and    CEP    (c).    There    are
            gap junctions to AVM (*d)and PVR (d).

            PLM
              The   cell   bodies   of   PLM   are   situated   in   the    lumbar    ganglia    (j).    Anteriorly    and    posteriorly
            directed   processes   emanate   from   the   cell   bodies   and   run   near   the   ventral   edge    of    the    lateral
            hypodermal   ridges   (g)   in   close   association   with   the   processes   of   PLN   for   part   of   their    length.
            Gap   junctions   are   made   to   PVC   (h),   LUA   (*d),    and    PVR    where    the    processes    of    PLM    cross
            the   lumbar   commissures   (j).   Each    HSN    sends    out    a    short    ventral    branch,    which    receives    a
            single   synapse   from   the   lateral   PLM   processes   (g).   The   processes   of    PLM    turn    and    enter    the
            ventral   cord   via   a   commissure   near   the   vulva.   The   process   of    PLML    does    not    get    over    the
            hypodermal   ridge   (which   is   rather   wide   at   this   point   due   to   the   proximity   of   the    vulva)    and
            has  no  synapses.  The   process   of   PLMR   runs   along   the   neuropile   of   the   cord   for   a   short   distance
            and synapses onto DVA (e), AVA (f), PDE (e) and AVD (e, f).

                                    ALN     AND      PLN

             Members: ALNL, ALNR, PLNL, PLNR.
               ALN   and   PLN   are   two   sets   of   two   neurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   in    the    lumbar    ganglion
             (e,   f,   g).   All   four   send   processes   anteriorly,   which   eventually   enter   the   nerve   ring;   they   also
             have   posteriorly   directed   processes    that    run    into    the    tailspike.    The    processes    of    ALN    run
             laterally and become closely associated with those of ALM in the anterior half of the animal

                                                              ALN AND PLN                                                           97

            (d).   They   then   enter   the   nerve   ring   sub-dorsally   and   run   ventrally   round   the   ring   for   a   short
            distance.   The   processes   from   PLN   are   closely   associated    with    those    of    PLM    in    the    posterior
            half  of   the   animal,   although   the   association   is   not   as   striking   as   that   of   ALN   with   ALM.   The
            processes  of  PLN  join   the   ventral   sub-lateral   cords   in   the   anterior   of   the   animal   and   from   there
            enter   the   ventral   cord   via   the   amphidial    commissures.    The    processes    of    PLN    then    enter    the
            nerve   ring   and   run   dorsally   for   a   short   distance.   The   main   synaptic   outputs   of   both    ALN    and
            PLN are dyadic synapses to SMB and SAA (a, b) and a few synapses to SMD (c).

                                   AQR      AND       PQR

            Members: AQR, PQR.
              Although   AQR   and    PQR    have    been    given    different    class    names,    they    have    several    features
            in   common   and   so   have   been    grouped    together.    Each    is    derived    from    an    equivalent    position
            on   bilaterally   symmetrical   lineages    (Sulston    &    Horvitz    1977)    and    each    has    a    small    cilium,
            which  is  not  part  of  a  sensillum  but   is   free   in   the   body   cavity   (b).   The   cell   body   of   AQR   is
            situated   laterally   on   the   right-hand   side   near   the   posterior   bulb    of    the    pharynx.    The    cilium
            is  on  a  small  process  emanating  from  the  cell  body  (i).  The  cell  body   of   PQR   is   in   the   left   lumbar
            ganglion  and  its   cilium   is   near   the   end   of   a   posteriorly   directed   process   (j).   The   main   process
            of   AQR   enters   the   ventral   cord   via   the   right-hand    deirid    commissure    and    runs    anteriorly.    It
            splits   near   the   nerve   ring   and   the   two   branches   run   round   each   side   of   the   nerve   ring,   near
            the  middle  of  the   ring   neuropile   and   in   close   association   with   the   process   of   DVA.   The   processes
            of   AQR   end   without   meeting   near   the   dorsal    mid-line.    The    main    synaptic    output    is    to    AVB
            (a,   c),   AVA   (c,   e),   RIA   (d),   BAG   (d),   PVC   (a)   and   AVD.   AQR   has   noticeably    denser    clusters
            of  vesicles  presynaptically  than   most   of   the   other   classes   of   neuron.   There   is   some   synaptic   input
            from   DVA   (*c)   and   many   gap   junctions   to   PVP    and    also    some    to    AVK    (*f)    and    RIG.    PQR
            sends   an   anteriorly   directed   process   that   enters   the    pre-anal    ganglion    and    runs    anteriorly    in
            the   ventral   region   of   the   process   bundle,   eventually   ending   somewhere   in   the    posterior    half    of
            the   ventral   cord.   The   main   synaptic   output   of   PQR   is   directed   to   AVA   (f,   g)    and    AVD    (g),
            usually   in   dyadic   combinations.   There   are   also   gap   junctions   to    PVP    (h)    and    there    is    some
            synaptic input from PVN (*c).

              ASn  is  a  set  of  eleven   motoneurons,   with   cell   bodies   in   the   ventral   cord,   which   innervate   dorsal
            muscles.  A   typical   ASn   (e.g.   AS3   (e))   has   rather   short   processes   in   the   ventral   cord   on   either
            side   of   its   cell   body.   These   are   exclusively   postsynaptic   and   receive    synaptic    input    from    AVB
            (*c),   AVA   (*e)   and   AVD   (*d).   In   addition   AS1   to   AS3   receive    some    synaptic    input    from    AVE
            (*f).  There   are   often   gap   junctions   to   AVA   (c)   and   VAn   (d)   in   this   region   also.   The   anterior
            process   (except   AS11   (f))   leaves   the   ventral   cord   and   runs   round   to    the    dorsal    cord    as    a
            commissure   (b).   All   eleven   ASn   commissures   run    round    the    right-hand    side    of    the    body.    The
            process  of   an   ASn   turns   and   runs   anteriorly   in   the   dorsal   cord,   running   for   part   of   the   time
            adjacent   to   the   basal   lamina.   There    are    dyadic    NMJs    in    this    region    with    VDn    being    the
            corecipient  (a  and  figure   19).   The   processes   of   ASn   in   the   dorsal   cord   are   similar   to   those   of
            DAn except that they are shorter and have fewer NMJs.

             ASE is a set of two ciliatcd neurons  that  are  part  of  the  amphid  sensilla.  The  endings  are
           in the amphid channel, which is open to the outside (figure  1).  Cell  bodies  are  situated  in  the
           lateral ganglia and have processes which  enter  the  ventral  cord  via  the  amphidial  commissures.
           From here they run anteriorly into the nerve ring and then run  round  it  in  the  posterior  regions
           of the neuropile, in close association with the processes of AIY. The distal region  of  each  process
           runs outside  the  proximal  region  of  the  contralateral  process.  These  two  processes  sandwich
           processes  of  AIY,  which  is  the  most  prominent  postsynaptic  partner  (a).  Synapses  are  also
           made onto AIA (b), RIA (c)  and  AIB,  usually  in  association  with  AWC  (d).  There  are  synaptic
           inputs from AIN (*a), AWA and ASI.

               ASG  is   a   set   of   two   ciliated   neurons   that   are   part   of   the   amphid   sensilla.   The   endings   are
             in  the  amphid  channel,  which   is   open   to   the   outside   (figure   1).   Cell   bodies   are   situated   in   the
             lateral   ganglia   and   send   processes   into    the    ventral    cord    via    the    amphidial    commissures.    The
             processes  run  on  the   outside   surface   of   the   neuropile   of   the   ventral   ganglion   in   close   association
             with   the   processes   of   AIA.   They   project   into   the   nerve   ring   a   short   distance,   ending   laterally.
             Synaptic   output   is   almost   exclusively   onto    AIA    (a).    Some    synapses    are    also    made    onto    AIB
             in  association  with  AIA,  but   AIB   always   seems   to   be   the   minor   partner   (b).   Some   of   the   vesicles
             in  the  synaptic   terminals   have   dark   cores   (a).   ASG   is   postsynaptic   to   AIM   in   a   few   places   (c)
             and has gap junctions with AIZ (d) and AIN.

              ASH is a set of two ciliated neurons  that  are  part  of  the  amphid  sensilla.  The  endings  are
            in the amphid channel, which is open to the outside (figure  1).  Cell  bodies  are  situated  in  the
            lateral ganglia and send  processes  into  the  ventral  cord  via  the  amphidial  commissures.  From
            there the two processes pass up into the nerve  ring,  running  near  the  middle  of  the  neuropile,
            and meet and terminate  at  the  dorsal  mid-line,  where  there  is  a  gap  junction  between  them.
            Processes from ASH run in  close  association  with  those  from  AIA  in  the  ventral  part  of  the
            ring and AVB in the dorsal part of the ring.  The  main  synaptic  output  is  to  AIA  (a).  Synapses
            are also made to  AIB,  RIA  (d)  and  to  AVB  (b)  often  in  association  with  AVA  and  AVD  (c).
            Some of the vesicles in the synaptic terminals have  dark  cores  (a).  There  are  gap  junctions  to
            AIZ, RIC, ADA and RMG.

               AS  I  is  a  set   of   two   ciliated   neurons   that   are   part   of   the   amphid   sensilla.   The   endings   are
             in  the  amphid  channel,  which   is   open   to   the   outside   (figure   1).   Cell   bodies   are   situated   in   the
             lateral   ganglia   and   send   processes    into    the    ventral    cord    via    the    amphid    commissures,    which
             project   anteriorly   into   the   nerve   ring.   They   run   round   the   nerve   ring   near   the   outside    surface
             and   meet   and   terminate   at   the   dorsal   mid-line    with    a    gap    junction    between    them    (d).    The
             processes   are   smaller   than   those   of   the   other   amphid   neurons   and   fewer   synapses   are    seen.    The
             main  synaptic   output   is   to   AIA   (a)   to   which   they   also   make   gap   junctions   (b).   There   are   also
             some   smaller   synapses   onto   AIB,   AWC    (c)    and    ASE.    Some    of    the    vesicles    in    the    synaptic
             terminals have dark cores (a).

               ASJ  is   a   set   of   two   ciliated   neurons   that   are   part   of   the   amphid   sensilla.   The   endings   are
             in  the  amphid  channel,  which   is   open   to   the   outside   (figure   1).   Cell   bodies   are   situated   in   the
             lateral ganglia and send processes into the ventral cord via the amphid commissures. These

             processes   run   anteriorly   near   the   lateral   extremities   of   the   ventral   cord   and   then    project    into
             the   nerve   ring   where   they   run   near   the   inner   surface.   At   all   times   the   processes   of   ASJ   run
             in    close    association    with    those    of    PVQ.    onto    which    they    synapse    extensively    and    almost
             exclusively   (a,   b).   The   processes   of   ASJ   meet   and   terminate   at   the   dorsal   mid-line   with   a   gap
             junction between them (c). A few of the vesicles in synapses have dark cores (a) but these are
             less   prominent   than   those   seen   in   the   other    amphidial    neurons.    Some    synapses    are    made    onto
             ASK but usually in association with PVQ. (d). There is some synaptic input from AIM (*b).

               ASK  is   a   set   of   two   ciliated   neurons   that   are   part   of   the   amphid   sensilla.   The   endings   are
             in  the  amphid  channel,  which   is   open   to   the   outside   (figure   1).   Cell   bodies   are   situated   in   the
             lateral   ganglia   and   send   processes    into    the    ventral    cord    via    the    amphid    commissures.    These
             processes   run   anteriorly   near   the   lateral   extremities   of   the   ventral   cord   and   then    project    into
             the   nerve   ring,   where   they   run   near   the    middle    of    the    neuropile.    The    processes    meet    and
             terminate   at   the   dorsal   mid-line   with   a   gap   junction   between   them   (b).    Some    of    the    vesicles
             in   the   synaptic   terminals   of   ASK   are   large   and   darkly    staining    (a).    The    predominant    synaptic
             output is to AIA (a, b). Some of the AIA synapses also include AIM (c) and AIB (d) as possible
                 partners. There is some synaptic input from ASJ (*d), PVQ, and AIM. ASK makes gap
             junctions with PVQ (a) and RMG.

              AUA  is   a   pair   of   neurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   in   the   lateral   ganglia.   Anteriorly   directed
            processes   leave   the   cell   bodies   and   run   along   with   the   bundles   of    processes    from    the    amphid
            sensilla  until  they  peter  out,  with  no   terminal   specializations,   just   in   front   of   the   first   bulb   of
            the  pharynx  (e).   A   second   process   comes   out   of   each   cell   body   and   enters   the   ventral   cord   via
            the  amphidial   commissures;   it   then   turns   and   runs   anteriorly   on   the   ventral   surface   of   the   cord.
            The   processes   of   AUA   then   enter   and   run   round   each   side   of   the   ring,   close   to    the    outside
            surface,   eventually   meeting   and   terminating   in   a   gap   junction   on   the   dorsal    mid-line.    The    main
            synaptic   output   is   to   RIB   (a,   b),   RIA   (a,   c),    AVE    (b)    and    AVA    (c)    in    various    dyadic
            combinations.   The   main   synaptic   input    is    from    URX    (*a)    and    ADF.    There    are    gap    junctions
            to URX, AWB and AIN (d).
              Magnifications: (a) x 25500, (b-d) x 17000.

            run   round   it,   near   the   outside   and   posterior   faces,   to   the   contralateral   side,   eventually   leaving
            the   ring   ventrally   and   entering   the   ventral    cord.    They    then    run    the    length    of    the    cord
            positioned near the centre of the process bundle (figure 18), ending near the posterior extremity

                                                                                            AVA                                                                                  121

            of     the     cord     in     the     pre-anal      ganglion.      The      processes      of      AVA      are      rather      large      and      lightly      staining
            (a);      together      with      those      of      AVB      they      are      the      most      prominent      interneurons      in       the       ventral       cord.
            In       the       nerve       ring       they       are       exclusively       postsynaptic       and       receive       extensive       synaptic       input.       The
            main      presynaptic      partners      in      this      region      are:      SAA      (*b),       FLP       (*a),       RIC       (*a),       DVC       (*c),       PVP
            (*c),      AUA      (*c),      ASH      (*b),      AQR      (*c),      ADL      (*d),      SDQ       (*b),       DVA       (*c)       and       RIB       (*g);       there
            are      gap      junctions      to      RIM,      URY      and      itself      (a).      In      the      ventral      cord      AVA      is      both      pre-      and
            postsynaptic,      although      the      chemical      synapses      that      it       makes       have       rather       few       vesicles       (b,       c,       d,
            e).      The      main      synaptic      output      is       to       the       ventral       cord       motoneurons:       VAn       (c),       DAn       (d),       ASn
            (e)     and     also     to      PVC      (b)      and      SAB.      PVC      (*g),      VAn      (*b),      DAn      (*c),      ASn      (*c)      and      SAB      (*c)
            have      gap      junctions       with       AVA.       There       is       considerable       synaptic       input       from       AVD       (*a),       AVE       (*a)
            and     AVB     (*b)     distributed     along     the     length     of     the     cord      as      well      as      some      less      extensive      input      from
            PVC       (*f),       ADE       (*b)       and       PLM       (*f).       In       the       pre-anal       ganglion,       AVA       receives        synapses        from
            PHB (*a), PQR (*g) and LUA (*a).

              AVB  is  a   pair   of   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   in   thc   lateral   ganglia.   Processes   leave
            the   cell   bodies   and   enter   the   ventral   cord   via   the   amphidial   commissures   (h).   They    then    turn,
            run  anteriorly  into  the   nerve   ring   and   run   right   round   it   near   the   middle   of   the   neuropile,   in
            close   association   with   the   processes   of   PVC   and   AVJ.   They   reenter   the    ventral    nerve    cord    on
            the  contralateral  side   and   run   along   it   in   the   dorsal   region   of   the   process   bundle   (figure   18),
            ending   in   the   posterior   body   before   the   pre-anal   ganglion   is    reached    (i).    AVB,    together    with
            AVA, are the most prominent interneurons of the ventral cord. The processes of AVB are large

             and    lightly    staining    (e,    f,    g)    and    have    several    short    projections    emanating    from     them     in     thc
             nerve   ring   (e,   f).   AVB   is   entirely    postsynaptic    in    thc    nerve    ring,    where    it    receives    many    synaptic
             inputs.    These    come    mainly    from     RIF     (*b),     RIM     (*f),     AVM     (*a),     PVC     (*b),     ASH     (*b),     PVR
             (*a),    PVP    (*a),    SDQ    (*a),    ADA    (*a),    AQR     (*a),     FLP     (*b),     AIB     (*c),     AVF     (*c),     ADL     and
             URX.    There    are    also    gap    junctions    to    RIB    (*g),    SIBV     (*d),     DVA     (*g),     RID     (*c),     SDQ     and
             itself    (g)    in    the    nerve    ring.    AVB    is    predominantly    presynaptic    in    the    ventral     cord,     where     it
             synapses    mainly    onto    AVA    (b),    ASn    (c)     and     the     hypodermis     (HDC)     (a)     together     with     a     few
             small    synapses    onto    AVD    (d)    and    AVE    (d).    There    are    gap    junctions    to    all    the    VBn    (*c)     and
             DBn   (*c)   motoneurons,    usually    in    the    vicinity    of    their    cell    bodies.    AVB    has    little    synaptic    input
             in the ventral cord; what there is comes from AVF (*c), PVN (*c) and PVC.

            Members: AVDL, AVDR.
              AVD   is   a   pair   of   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   situated    in    the    lateral    ganglia.    Anteriorly
            directed  processes   leave   the   cell   bodies   and   enter   the   ring   sub-dorsally,   where   they   initially   run
            near  the  inside  surface  of   the   neuropile.   They   move   out   near   the   outside   surface   as   the   processes
            cross   over   on   the   dorsal   mid-line   (e)   and   move   back   to   the   middle   of   the   neuropile   as    they
            carry   on   round   the   ring.   They   then   enter   the   ventral   cord   where    they    run    near    the    middle
            of the process bundle (figure 18), eventually ending in the pre-anal ganglion. The processes

                                                                              AVD                                                                  129

            of    AVD    are    exclusively     postsynaptic     in     the     nerve     ring     and     are     lightly     staining.     The     main
            synaptic    input    in    this    region    is    from    ASH    (*c),     ADL     (*d),     FLP     (*b),     PVC     (*c)     and     AQR.
            There     are     gap     junctions     to     ADA     (*d)     and     FLP.     AVD     is     predominantly     presynaptic     in      the
            ventral    cord    having    the    same     post-synaptic     partners     as     AVE.     It     makes     many     synapses     to     AVA
            (a,   b,   c,   d)   and   several   to   SAB   (f,   g),   VAn   (a),   DAn   (c)   and    ASn    (d),    usually    in    various    dyadic
            combinations.    There    are    some    striking    synaptic    complexes    in    the    vicinity     of     the     cell     bodies     of
            the      SAB      neurons,      where      two       presynaptic       specializations       from       AVD       and/or       AVE       (and
            sometimes    also    AVA)     occur     in     the     same     region     with     the     processes     of     SAB,     DA1     and     VA1
            sandwiched    in    between    (f).    The    main    synaptic    input    to    AVD    in    the    ventral     cord     is     from     PQR
            (*g),    LUA    (*a),    PVN    (*b)    and    PLM    (*f),    there     are     also     minor     inputs     from     AVB     (*b),     PHB
            (*c)    and    possibly    PVW    (*c).    There    are    gap    junctions    to    AVJ,    AVM    (*e)    and    FLP    in    the     cord.

              AVE  is   a   pair   of   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   in   the   lateral   ganglion   close   to   the
            ring  neuropile.   Processes   from   the   cell   bodies   enter   the   ring   laterally   and   run   anteriorly   through
            the  neuropile  until   they   are   near   the   anterior   surface.   They   then   turn   dorsally   and   start   running
            round  the   ring   in   close   association   with   the   processes   of   AIB.   When   the   processes   of   AVE   reach
            the dorsal mid-line they turn and run anteriorly for a short distance until the anterior surface

            processes   of   RIB,   until    they    leave    the    ring    ventrally    and    enter    the    ventral    cord.    They    run    near
            the   centre   of   the   nerve   cord   (figure   18)    and    eventually    end    before    the    vulva    is    reached    (j).    The
            processes   of    AVE    are    exclusively    postsynaptic    in    the    nerve    ring    and    are    lightly    staining    in    this
            region.     They     receive     many     synapses,      particularly      from      the      mechanosensory      system.      The      main
            synaptic    input    is     from     OLL     (*a),     URY     (*b),     CEP     (*d),     URX     (*b),     DVA     (*a),     RIB     (*h),
            RIS    (*a),    BAG    (*c)    and    AUA    (*b);    there    are    also    a    few    synapses    from    FLP    (*b),     ALA     (*a),
            AVK     (*a),     AIZ,     RIG,     PVC     (*a)     and     RMG.     There     are     gap     junctions     to     RIM      (*h),      RME
            (g)    and    RMD    (h)    in    the    ring.    AVE    is    predominantly    presynaptic    in    the    ventral     cord     and     has
            the    same    postsynaptic    partners    as    AVD.    It    makes    many    synapses    onto    AVA     (a)     and     also     several
            onto    SAB    (b,    c),    VAn    (c,    e),    DAn    (d)    and    ASn    (f),    usually    in     various     dyadic     combinations.
            There    are    some    striking    synaptic    complexes    in    the    vicinity    of    the    SAB    cell    bodies,     where     both
            AVEL     and     AVER     have     presynaptic     specializations     in     the     same     region     with     processes     of     SAB,
            VA1    and    DA1    sandwiched    in    between     (c).     There     is     some     synaptic     input     from     AVJ     (*d)     and
            AVB (*d) in the ventral cord.

            Members: AVFL, AVFR.
              AVF is a pair of interneurons with bipolar cell bodies  situated  in  the  retro-vesicular  ganglion.
            Anteriorly directed processes leave the cell bodies and  run  together  round  the  left  side  of  the
            excretory  duct  and  then  enter  the  nerve  ring.  They  run  right  round  the  nerve  ring  on   a
            trajectory which is near the  inside  and  posterior  surfaces  of  the  neuropile,  eventually  ending
            ventrally. The posteriorly directed processes  from  the  cell  bodies  of  AVF  run  together  in  the
            dorsal regions of  the  ventral  cord  and  end  in  the  pre-anal  ganglion.  The  processes  of  AVFL
            and AVFR are at all times  closely  associated.  AVF  makes  a  few  rather  small  synapses,  although
            in the nerve ring there are several regions that have vesicle-filled varicosities  with  no  associated
            synaptic contacts (b). The main synaptic output  in  the  nerve  ring  is  to  AVB  (a),  HSN  (a)  and
            AVJ;  the  main  synaptic  input  is  from  AIM  and  HSN  (*c).  In  the  ventral   cord   there   are
            chemical synapses  to  and  from  AVH  (c  and  *d)  as  well  as  several  gap  junctions.  There  are
            also a few synapses  to  AVB  (c)  and  several  other  synapses  including  a  couple  of  small  NMJs
            (d)  and  a  few  synapses  with  no  obvious  postsynaptic  partner.  There  are  many  rather   small
            gap junctions between AVFL and AVFR along the length of the cord.

            AVG   is   a   single   interneuron   with   its   cell   body   situated    in    the    retro-vesicular    ganglion.    A
          posteriorly  directed,   fairly   large   process   leaves   the   cell   body   and   runs   in   the   dorsal   region   of
          the  cord  down   to   the   pre-anal   ganglion.   Here   it   runs   to   the   left   of   the   anus   and   enters   the
          dorso-rectal   ganglion   and   from   there   runs   down   the   dorsal   hypodermal   ridge   to   the    tip    of    the
          tail.  The  disposition  of  the  posterior  extremities  of  this   process   suggest   that   it   could   be   a   sensory
          dendrite.   There   are   a   few   scattered   synapses   in   the   ventral   cord   (e.g.   d)    the    most    prominent
          of   which   are   some   synapses   to   AVB   (a).    There    are    several    synapses    onto    the    basal    lamina
          surrounding    the    nerve    cord    with    no    obvious    postsynaptic    partners    (c).    The     most     striking
          features   of   AVG   are   the   gap   junctions   it   makes   with   RIF   in   the    retro-vesicular    ganglion    (b).
          A  short  anteriorly  directed  process   from   AVG   often   pokes   into   the   cell   bodies   of   one   of   the   RIF
          neurons (b).

              AVH  is  a  pair   of   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   in   the   lateral   ganglia.   Processes   from   the   cell
            bodies   enter   the   nerve   ring   sub-dorsally   and   cross   over   to    the    contralateral    side.    They    then
            travel  ventrally  round  the   ring,   running   near   the   middle   of   the   neuropile,   and   leave   it   to   enter
            the  ventral  cord.   The   processes   of   AVH   run   in   the   dorsal   regions   of   the   cord   and   end   in   the
            pre-anal   ganglion.   The    chemical    synapses    made    by    AVH    are    rather    small,    with    few    synaptic
            vesicles.   The   main   synaptic   outputs   are   to   AVJ   (c),    PVP,    SMB    (b),    ADF    (a)    and    RIR    (a)
            in  the  nerve  ring.  In  the   ventral   cord   there   are   synapses   to   and   from   AVF   (d,   *c)   as   well   as
            gap junctions to AVF and also a few synapses from PHA.

             AVJ  is  a  pair  of   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   in   the   lateral   ganglion.   Processes   from   the   cell
           bodies  enter  the  ring  sub-dorsally  and   then   run   round   it   to   the   contralateral   side   near   the   centre
           of  the  neuropile,  in  close   association   with   the   processes   of   AVB.   The   processes   of   AVJ   then   leave
           the   ring   ventrally   and   traverse   the   length    of    the    ventral    cord,    running    immediately    adjacent
           and   dorsal   to   the   processes   of   AVB   and   eventually   petering   out   in   the   pre-anal   ganglion.    There
           are   few   synapses   from   AVJ;    and    those    that    are    present    are    rather    small    and    have    some
           dark-cored   vesicles.   The   main   synaptic   output   is   directed   to   PVC    (a),    AVB    (a)    and    RIS    (b)
           in   the   nerve   ring,   and   to   AVE   (d)   and   AVD   in   the   ventral    cord.    The    main    synaptic    input
           is   from   BDU   (*a),   AVH   (*c),   ADA   (*c),    ADL,    PVR    (*b),    RIF    (*b),    HSN    and    PVC    in    the
           nerve   ring   and   PVN   (*b)   and   AVF   in   the   nerve   ring   and   ventral   cord.    AVJ    has    a    prominent
           gap   junction   with   RIS   in   the   neuropile   of   the   ventral   ganglion   (c);   RIS   sends   a   short    branch
           down   into   the   ncuropile   of   the   cord   in   this   region.   There   are   gap   junctions   to   PVC   (*h)    in
           the nerve ring and to AVD, PVC and itself in the ventral cord.

              AVK   is   a   pair   of   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   in   the   ventral    ganglion    behind    the
            excretory   duct.   Anteriorly   directed   processes   leave   the   cell   bodies   and   run   near    the    centre    of
            the   neuropile.   They   move   ventrally   as   the   nerve   ring   is   approached   and    then    run    right    round
            the   ring   near   the   outside   surface,   emerging   on   the   contralateral   side   adjacent   to    the    processes
            of  their  partners.   At   all   times,   in   the   regions   of   overlap,   the   processes   of   AVK   run   in   close
            association   with   those   of    their    contralateral    partners.    The    processes    travel    down    the    length
            of the ventral cord running in the ventral regions of the process bundles on either side of the

            hypodermal    ridge    (c),    eventually    petering    out    in    the    pre-anal    ganglion.    The    main    synaptic
            output  in  the  nerve  ring  is  on  the  dorsal   side   and   is   directed   to   RIM   (a,   b),   AVE   (a)   and   SMD
            (b).   Synapses   are   received    mainly    from    DVB    (*b),    RMF    (*e)    and    RIG    (*f).    AVK    has    gap
            junctions to several partners, namely itself, SMB (e), AQR (f), DVB, PVP (g), RIC, ADE (*d)
            and   RIG.   In   the   ventral   cord   there   are   a   few   small   synapses   to   hypodermal    cells    (HDC)    (d)
            and   PDE   (c).   AVK   receives   synapses   from   PDE   (*b)   and   PVM   (*f).   There   are    also    some    rather
            marginal gap junctions to PVP.

            Member:  AVL.
              AVL  is  a  motoneuron/interneuron  with  its  cell  body  situated  in  the  ventral  ganglion.   An
            anteriorly directed process runs in the mid-line  on  the  dorsal  surface  of  the  neuropile  of  the
            ventral ganglion. It enters the ring on the  left  and  makes  a  complete  circuit  running  near  the
            outside surface and the anterior face.  It  then  re-enters  the  neuropile  of  the  ventral  ganglion
            and runs posteriorly down the length of the  ventral  cord  running  in  the  ventral  regions  of  the
            process bundle. AVL has  few  synaptic  connections  in  the  nerve  ring.  In  the  ventral  cord  the
            synapses are rather small  and  are  onto  muscles  (a),  SAB  (b)  and  VD12.  Synapses  are  received
            from  DVB  and  PVP  (*e).  There  is  a  gap  junction  to   PVM   (d),   DVB   and   several   rather
            marginal gap junctions to DVC.

             Members' AVM, PVM.
               AVM    and    PVM,    although    given    separate    class    names,    have     been     grouped     together     because
             of   their   many   common   features.   Both   are   known   to   be   touch   receptors   (Chalfie   &   Sulston   1981    )
             and   share   with   ALM   and   PLM   the   large   microtubules   that   are   present   on    the    regions    of    their
             processes   which   are   adjacent   to   the   cuticle   (Chalfie   &   Thomson    1982).    The    cell    body    of    PVM
             is  situated  laterally,  on  the  left-hand  side  of  the  posterior  half  of  the   body   (i).   A   process   from   the
             cell   body   enters   the   ventral   cord   via   a   commissure   and   runs   anteriorly   along   it   in   an    extreme
             ventral   location   adjacent   to   the   cuticle.   It   terminates   in   the   anterior    body    after    making    some
             en   passant   synapses,   mainly   to   AVK   (f),   PDE   (g),   PVC   (h)   and    PVR.    There    are    gap    junctions
             to   PDE   and   AVL   (*d).   The   cell   body   of   AVM   is   situated   laterally,   on   the   right-hand    side    of
             the  anterior   half   of   the   body   (i).   A   process   leaves   the   cell   body   and   enters   the   ventral   cord
             via a commissure, and then runs anteriorly along it in an extreme ventral location, alongside

             the  process   of   PVM.   It   terminates   at   a   position   just   beyond   the   first   bulb   of   the   pharynx.   A
             branch   leaves   the   main   process   and   enters   the   neuropile   of    the    ventral    ganglion.    This    splits
             and  the  branches  enter  the  nerve  ring  at   each   side,   but   terminate,   while   still   in   the   ventral   half
             of  the   ring,   with   gap   junctions   to   the   ends   of   the   processes   of   ALM.   Nearly   all   the   synapses
             of   AVM   are   on   these   branches.   The   main   synaptic   output   is   to   AVB   (a),    PVC    (a),    BDU    (b),
             ADE (c) and PVR. AVM has gap junctions with ALM (d) and AVD (e).

             cord  near  the  ventral   surface   of   the   cord   and   project   into   the   nerve   ring,   where   they   run   near
             the   middle   of   the   neuropile.   The   processes   of   AWA   meet   and   terminate    at    the    dorsal    mid-line
             with   a   gap   junction.   The   predominant   synaptic   output    is    to    AIZ    (a);    there    are    also    some
             synapses   to   AFD   (b),   AIY   (c)   and   ASE   usually    in    dyadic    combination    with    AIZ.    A    few    of
             the synaptic vesicles are dark cored (a). There are gap junctions to AIA (d).

          AWB   is   a   set   of   two   ciliated   neurons   with   flattened,   sheet-like   endings    that    are    associated
        with  the  sheath  cells  of   the   amphid   sensilla   (figure   1).   Cell   bodies   are   situated   in   the   lateral
        ganglion   and   send   processes   into   the   ventral    cord    via    the    amphid    commissures.    The    processes

        junction.   The   processes   are   fairly   small   and   none   of   the   synapses    is    very    large.    The    main
        synaptic   output   is   to   AIZ   and   ADF,   usually   together   in   a   dyadic   synapse   (a).   There   are    also
        synapses to RIA (b) and AVB (c). There are gap junctions to RMG (d) and AUA.

              AWC   is   a   set   of   two   ciliated   neurons    with    large,    flattened,    sheet-like    endings    that    are
            associated  with  the   sheath   cells   of   the   amphid   sensilla   (figure   1).   The   cell   bodies   of   AWC   are
            situated   in   the   lateral   ganglia   and    send    processes    into    the    ventral    cord    via    the    amphid
            commissures.   These   turn   anteriorly   and   run   near   the   lateral   surfaces    of    the    cord.    They    then
            enter  the   nerve   ring   which   they   then   run   right   round   adjacent   to   the   posterior   surface;   finally
            ending   ventrally.   The   main   synaptic   output   is   to   AIY   (a),   AIB   (b)   and   AIA   (c)   which   synapses
            back   to   AWC   reciprocally   (d).   AWC    also    has    some    synaptic    input    from    ASE    (*d)    and    ASI
            (*c). Occasional dark vesicles are seen at synapses (a).

 BAG                                               165

            Members: BAGL, BAGR.
              BAG  is  a  set  of  two  neurons  with  ciliated   endings,   in   the   head,   with   elliptical,   closed,   sheet-like
            processes   near   the   cilium,   which   envelop   a   piece   of   hypodermis   (figure    1).    These    endings    have
            no   associated   sheath   and   socket   cells   and   so   are   not   directly   attached   to   the    hypodermis.    The
            cell  bodies   are   situated   anterior   to   the   nerve   ring,   just   ventral   of   lateral,   and   send   processes
            anteriorly  to  the   ciliated   endings   in   the   head.   Posteriorly   directed   processes   enter   the   nerve   ring
            from   the   cell   bodies   and   then   run   round   the   ring   to   the   contralateral   side   near    the    outside
            surface   of   the   neuropile,   eventually   ending   ventrally.   The   main   synaptic   output    is    to    RIA    (a,
            b),   RIB   (a,   c),   AVE   (c)   and   RIG   (b).   There   are   a   few   dark-cored   vesicles    in    the    synaptic
            terminals   (a).   There   is   some   synaptic    input    from    AIN    (*b),    RIG    (*d)    and    AQR    (*d).    BAG
            has gap junctions with itself, RIR (d) and RIG (*h),
              Magnifications: (a, b) x 25500, (c, d) x 12750.

              BDU  is  a  set   of   two   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   laterally   in   the   anterior   body   (f).
            Single   processes   project   anteriorly   from   each   cell   body   and   run   adjacent   to   the   excretory    canal,
            until   they   enter   the   retro-vesicular    ganglion    via    deirid    commissures.    The    processes    then    run.
            anteriorly   on   either   side   of   the   ventral   hypodermal   ridge   until   the   nerve   ring   is   reached.   This
            they  enter,   running   round   near   the   inside   surface   of   the   neuropile   in   close   association   with   the
            processes   of    PVN,    finally    meeting    and    terminating    on    the    dorsal    mid-line.    The    presynaptic
            regions   of   chemical   synapses    from    BDU    are    generally    rather    small    but    have    striking,    darkly
            staining  vesicles  (a,   b,   c,   d).   The   main   synaptic   output   of   BDU   is   to   AVJ   (a),   PVN   (c),   ADE
            (b)   and   HSN   (d).   The   main   synaptic    inputs    are    from    ALM    (*a),    AVM    (*b),    HSN    (*d)    and
            PVN (*a).

             CAN  is  a  set  of  two  cells   that   are   closely   associated   with   the   excretory   canal.   The   cell   bodies
           of  CAN  are  situated   adjacent   and   dorsal   to   the   excretory   canal   at   about   the   level   of   the   vulva
           (d).   Anteriorly   and   posteriorly   directed   processes   emanate   from    the    cell    bodies    and    run    along
           the   canal   in   close   association   with   the   processes   of   ALA   and   PVD.   The   anterior   process   of   CAN
           ends   just   behind   the   nerve   ring   (d).   The   three   canal-associated    processes    on    each    side,    ALA,
           CAN    and    PVD,    have    not    been    completely    reconstructed    although    they    have    been    sampled    in
           several  places.  Two  of  the  processes  end  at   about   the   level   of   the   anus   and   the   third   enters   the
           pre-anal    ganglia    and    synapses    onto     PVC     (ALA-d).     A     single     synapse     onto     the     lateral
           hypodermis   has   also    been    seen    on    one    of    the    processes    (c).    Apart    from    a    few    rather
           unconvincing   gap   junctions   to   the   excretory   canal   (b),    no    other    synapses    can    be    unambiguously
           assigned   to   CAN.   Laser   ablation   experiments   have,   however,   shown    it    to    be    essential    for    the
           survival of the animal (J. Sulston, unpublished observations).

              CEP is a set of four neurons with  ciliated  endings  in  the  cephalic  sensilla  (figure  1).  The
            dorsal pair of cell bodies is situated in the  pseudocoelomic  cavity  posterior  to  the  nerve  ring
            (along with those of URX). The ventral cell bodies are situated  anterior  to  the  ring  and  closely
            apposed to the ring neuropile (b). Anteriorly directed  processes  run  in  four  of  the  six  labial
            process bundles  to  the  receptor  endings  in  the  head.  Posteriorly  directed  processes  emanate
            from the ventral CEP pair and loop round the posterior face of the ring neuropile; they then

                            CEP                                                                                                                          173

           enter it on the inside surface adjacent to the muscle  arms  (j,  c).  The  processes  branch  at  this
           point and run both ways round the nerve  ring  on  the  inside  surface  near  the  posterior  face  of
           the ring neuropile. The  dorsal  branch  ends;  the  ventral  branch  loops  round  and  runs  dorsally
           in the middle of the  anterior  regions  of  the  ring  neuropile.  The  dorsal  pair  of  CEP  neurons
           send out anteriorly directed processes,  which  enter  the  ring  near  the  dorsal  mid-line  (i)  and
           then run ventrally on the inside of the  ring  neuropile  adjacent  to  the  muscle  arms.  These  then
           loop back and run in  the  middle  of  the  anterior  regions  of  neuropile,  eventually  moving  back
           to the inner surface, where they end.  The  main  synaptic  output  is  to  RIC  (a,  g),  AVE  (d,  f,
           h),  OLL  (f),  OLQ.  (e),  IL1  (e),  RMH  (g),  RMD   (h),   RMG,   URA   and   URB.   CEP   synapses
           have been shown to contain  the  neurotransmitter  dopamine  (Sulston  et  al.  1975).  There  is  some

                                      DAn

            Members: DA1 to DA9.
              DAn is a set of nine  motoneurons  that  innervate  dorsal  muscles  and  have  cell  bodies  in  the
            ventral cord. A typical DAn (e.g.  DA3  (e))  has  an  exclusively  postsynaptic,  anteriorly  directed
            process in the ventral cord that runs in the ventral regions of the cord. It  receives  synaptic  input
            from  AVA  (*d)  and  AVD  (*c);  in  addition,  DA1-DA4  receive  synaptic  input   from   AVE   (*d),
            DA8  receives  input  from  DVB  and  DA9  from  PHC  (*a).  There  are  gap  junctions  to   AVA   (c)
            and  occasional  gap  junctions  to  VAn.  DA1  and  DA2  also  have  gap  junctions  to  SAB  and  DA9
            to PHC (d).  A  posteriorly  directed  process  from  DAn  leaves  the  ventral  cord  and  runs  round
            to the dorsal  cord.  All  except  those  from  DA2  and  DA9  go  round  as  a  left-hand  commissure,
            passing through the  ventral  hypodermal  ridge  (b).  The  process  of  DAn  runs  anteriorly  in  the
            dorsal cord  with  the  proximal  regions  of  the  process  running  adjacent  to  the  basal  lamina.
            There are many NMJs in this  region,  which  are  nearly  all  dyadic,  with  VDn  as  the  corecipient
            (a). The distal regions  of  the  dorsal  DAn  processes  are  generally  not  adjacent  to  the  basal
            lamina and have few, if any, synaptic contacts.

             DBn is a set of seven motoneurons that innervate dorsal muscles and have cell bodies in the
            ventral   cord.   A   typical   DBn   (e.g.   DBa   (e))   has   an   exclusively    postsynaptic,    posteriorly    directed
            process  in  the  ventral  cord  that  runs  in  the  ventral   regions   of   the   cord.   It   receives   synaptic   input
            from   PVC   (*e)   and   occasionally    from    DVA    (*f).    There    are    prominent    gap    junctions    to    AVB,
            usually  situated  near   the   cell   body   (c).   A   process,   which   either   comes   directly   out   of   the   cell
            body  or   just   anteriorly   to   it,   leaves   the   ventral   cord   and   runs   round   tothe   dorsal   cord   as   a
            commissure.   DB2,   DB4   and   DB5   run   round   the   left-hand   side   of   the    body;    the    others    run    on
            the  right.   The   process   of   DBn   turns   and   runs   posteriorly   on   reaching   the   dorsal   cord,   with   the
            proximal   regions   of   the   process   running   adjacent    to    the    basal    lamina.    There    are    many    NMJs
            in   this   region,   most   of   which   are   dyadic,   with   VDn   as   the   corecipient   (a).   There   are   also   a
            few   dyadic   synapses   to   DDn   and   VDn   (b)   and   gap   junctions   to   adjacent    DBns    (d).    The    distal
            regions   of   the   dorsal   cord   processes   move   away   from   the   basal   lamina   and   are    generally    devoid
            of any synaptic contacts.

              DDn  is  a   set   of   six   motoneurons,   with   cell   bodies   in   the   ventral   cord,   which   innervate   dorsal
            muscles.   Each   cell   has   a   short,   posteriorly   directed   and    a    longer,    anteriorly    directed    process
            emanating   from   its   cell   body.   The   anterior   process   has   a   branch,   which   leaves   the   ventral    cord
            as   a   commissure   and   runs   round   to   the   dorsal   cord.   (The   DD1    commissure    runs    to    the    left,
            the   rest   to   the   right.)   The   commissures   often   run   through    the    hypodermal    ridge    when    entering
            or   leaving   the   nerve   cords   (b).   The   commissure   splits,   as   it   enters   the   dorsal   cord,   into    an
            anteriorly   and    a    posteriorly    directed    process,    which    span    approximately    the    same    longitudinal
            region   of   the   body   as   their   ventral   counterparts.   Both   the   dorsal   and   the   ventral   processes   run
            adjacent   to   the   basal   lamina   bounding   the   cord   and   run   in   close   association   with   the    processes
            of   the   VDn   neurons.   In   the   ventral   cord   they   run   between   the   more    dorsal    processes    of    the
            VC   neurons   and   the   more   ventral   processes   of   the   VAn   and   VBn    neurons    (figure    18).    In    the
            dorsal   cord   they   run   to   ventral   of   the   other   motoneuron   classes   (figure   10).   The   DDn    processes
            in   the   ventral   cord   are   exclusively   postsynaptic   and   receive   synaptic   input    from    VAn    (d),    VBn
            (*a)   and   VCn   (*b)   as   corecipients   at   NMJs,   often   with   short    dendritic    spines    intercepting    the
            NMJs   (as   in   VAn-a).   The   processes   in   the   dorsal    cord    are    predominantly    presynaptic    and    have
            many   NMJs   (a),   most   of   which   have   only   muscle   as   the   postsynaptic   partner.   The    role    of    the
            dorsal  and  ventral  processes  is  reversed   in   the   first   larval   stage   and   switches   round   to   the   adult
            configuration   at   about   the   time   of   the   first   moult   (White   et   al.   1978).   The   processes   of    DDn
            and   VDn   do   not   have    extended,    apparently    undifferentiated,    distal    regions,    as    do    the    other
            classes   of    motoneuron;    instead,    they    end    abruptly    in    close    proximity    to    the    end    of    a
            neighbouring   process   of   the   same   class   and   there   is   usually   a   gap   junction    between    them    (d).
            There are also a few gap junctions to VDn neurons (c).

               DVA   is   a   single   interneuron   with   its   cell    body    situated    in    the    dorso-rectal    ganglion.    An
             anteriorly  directed   process   enters   the   pre-anal   ganglion   (i)   and   runs   in   the   ventral   part   of   the
             process  bundle  for  the  whole  length  of  the  ventral   cord.   It   enters   the   nerve   ring   on   the   right-hand
             side  and  travels  right   round   it   in   an   anticlockwise   direction   (h)   running   near   the   centre   of   the
             neuropile  in   close   association   with   the   process   of   AQR;   it   then   ends   shortly   after   rejoining   the
             ventral  cord  on  the  left   hand   side.   The   process   of   DVA   is   generally   rather   large   and   has   large,
             vesicle-filled  varicosities  in  the  nerve   ring   (b).   The   vesicles   tend   to   be   irregularly   shaped,   except
             in   the   vicinity   of   the   presynaptic   specializations,   where    they    are    smaller    and    more    spherical
             (a,  b).  In  the  nerve  ring  the  main   synaptic   output   is   to   AVE   (a,   b,   e);   there   are   some   smaller
             synapses   to   RIR   (e),   AVA   (c),   AQR   (c),   SMB,   AIZ   and   AUA   (b)   and    there    are    gap    junctions
             to  AVB  (g).  There  is  a   little   synaptic   input   from   AIZ   and   SDQ.   (*a).   In   the   ventral   cord   there
             are   some   small   synapses   to   PVC   (f),   PVR,   DBn   (f)   and   VBn    (d);    there    are    several    synapses
             from   PDE   (*a)   and   some   from   PHC   (*c),   PLM   (*e),   PHA    (*a)    and    PVD    (*d);    there    are    gap
             junctions to PVR.

              DVB    is    a    single    interneuron/motoneuron    with    its    cell    body    situated    in    the     dorso-rectal
            ganglion.   An   anteriorly   directed   process   enters   the   ventral   cord   and   runs   in   the    dorsal    regions
            of  the  process  bundle  until   the   nerve   ring   is   reached.   This   then   enters   the   nerve   ring   close   to
            the  ventral  mid-line   and   runs   right   round   it   in   a   clockwise   direction   on   the   outside   surface   of
            the  neuropile.  At   all   times   along   its   length,   the   process   of   DVB   runs   in   close   association   with
            that   of   DVC.   In   the   nerve   ring   the   main   synaptic   output   is   to   AVK   (b),   AIB   (a),   RMF    (a),
            DVC   and   RIG   and   there   are   gap   junctions   to    AVK,    RIB    and    AIB.    The    synaptic    activity    in
            the   ventral   cord   is   restricted   to   the   pre-anal   ganglion,   where   there   are   NMJs   to   the   intestinal
            and   anal   depressor   muscles   (c),   and   also   synapses   to   the   rectal   epithelial   cell   (d),   AVL,    DA8,
            DD6,   PDA   and   DVC.   Some   of   the   presynaptic   endings   in   the   nerve   ring    have    a    few    dark-cored
            vesicles (b). There is a gap junction to AVL.

            Member: DVC.
              DVC   is   a   single   interneuron   with   its   cell    body    situated    in    the    dorso-rectal    ganglion.    An
            anteriorly   directed   process   enters   the   ventral   cord   and   runs   in   the   dorsal   part   of   the    process
            bundle  until   the   nerve   ring   is   reached.   It   enters   the   nerve   ring   close   to   the   ventral   mid-line
            and  then   runs   right   round   it   in   a   clockwise   direction   on   the   outside   surface   of   the   neuropile.
            At  all  times   along   its   length,   the   process   of   DVC   runs   in   close   association   with   that   of   DVB.
            In  the  nerve  ring   the   main   synaptic   output   is   to   RIG   (a,   b),   AVA   (c),   AIB   (c)   and   RMF   (b),
            and  there  are   gap   junctions   to   AIB.   In   the   ventral   cord   there   is   some   synaptic   input   from   DVB
            and   there   are   also   many   gap   junctions   to   PVP   (d)   and    several    rather    marginal    gap    junctions
            to AVL and VD1.

              FLP is a set of two  neurons,  which  have  ciliated  endings  situated  immediately  dorsal  to  the
            lateral inner labial sensilla in the head but have no associated sheath  or  socket  cells.  They  have
            flattened processes in this region of the cilium (figure 1 ).  The  processes  from  'the  endings  run
            down in the lateral labial process bundles but do not  enter  the  nerve  ring  along  with  the  other
            processes; instead they  continue  posteriorly  and  join  up  with  their  cell  bodies  laterally.  A
            branch comes off this process anterior to the  cell  body  and  runs  backwards  alongside  the  dorsal
            muscle  quadrants.  Small  processes  emanate  from  this  branch  and  run  underneath   the   muscles
            for a short distance (e). Processes from  the  cell  bodies  enter  the  retro-vesicular  ganglion  via
            the deirid commissures and run together  anteriorly,  near  the  middle  of  the  cord,  ending  before
            the nerve ring is reached. Most of the synaptic interactions occur in  this  region  of  the  cord  but
            there are also a few synapses on the lateral processes in the vicinity  of  the  nerve  ring  (c).  The
            main  synaptic  outputs  are  to  AVA  (a),  AVD  (a,  b),  AVB  (b),  AIB  and  ADE  (c)  in   various
            dyadic combinations. There  is  possibly  some  synaptic  input  from  ADE.  There  are  gap  junctions

               GLR  is  a  set  of  six  cells  that  are  situated  posteriorly   to   the   nerve   ring,   close   to   the   neuropile
             (a).   Cell   bodies   are   situated    in    a    sixfold    symmetrical    arrangement    and    send    processes    that
             project   anteriorly   and   run   adjacent   to   the   pharynx.   All   six   processes   peter   out   and    end,    with
             no   terminal   specializations,   at   the   level   of   the   junction   of   the   pharynx   and   the   buccal   cavity.
             Each   process   flattens   out   into   a   sheet,   which   touches   its   neighbour   on    each    side,    forming    a
             cylinder   as   they   pass   the   inside   surface   of   the   nerve   ring.   Muscle   arms   from   the   head   muscles
             run  posteriorly  down  the  outside   of   the   nerve   ring   and   then   turn   to   run   anteriorly,   next   to   the
             inside   surface   of   the   nerve   ring,   where   they   are   sandwiched   between   the   cylinder   of    GLR    cells
             and  the  motor  endplate  region  of  the  nerve  ring   (a,   b,   c).   It   is   in   this   region   that   the   muscle
             arms receive their synaptic input from the motoneurons of the nerve ring. The muscle arms

            are   highly   ordered   in   this   region,   arms   from   individual   muscle   rows   running   along    specific    GLR
            cells   (figure   15).   Gap   junctions   are   seen   between   GLR   cells   and   muscle   arms   (c)   and   also   RME
            motoneurons   (d),   but   not   between   adjacent   GLR   cells    even    though    they    touch    in    this    region
            (e).   At   the   anterior   extremity   of   the   ring   the   GLR   processes   lose    their    sheet-like    morphology
            and   revert   to   a   small   cylindrical   form.   These   processes   run   anteriorly   and    are    always    closely
            apposed  with  the   IL1   (h)   dendrites   until   they   end.   The   nuclei   of   the   GLR   cells   are   small   and
            the    cytoplasm    contains    large,    irregularly    shaped,     membrane-bound     vesicles,     which     are     more
            prominent  in  the  larva  (f)   than   the   adult   stages   (g).   No   chemical   synapses   have   been   seen   either
            to  or  from  these  cells.  The  disposition   and   the   layout   of   these   cells   suggest   that   they   might   be
            glial   cells   and   might   act   to   guide   growing   muscle   arms   and   the    sensory    dendrites    from    each
            of the labia in the head.

             Members: HSNL, HSNR.
               HSN   is   a   set   of   two   motoneurons    that    innervate    vulval    muscles    in    the    hermaphrodite.    The
             cell   bodies   of   HSN   are   situated   sub-ventrally   just   posterior   to   the   vulva.   A   few   short   branches
             come   off   the   processes   in   the   vicinity   of   the   vulva    which    have    several    synapses.    The    main
             processes   enter   the   ventral   cord   and   run   anteriorly   on   either    side    of    the    ventral    hypodermal
             ridge   eventually   entering   the   nerve   ring.   The   processes   of   HSN   run   right   round    the    ring    near
             the posterior surface and end ventrally. Processes from HSN neurons were not present in the
             JSH animal and so, presumably, they must grow into the nerve ring sometime during or after
             the  L4  larval   stage.   The   main   synaptic   output   from   HSN   is   on   the   branches   near   the   cell   body.
             The   VCn   axons   and   the   processes   from   HSN   separate   dorsally   from   the   main    body    of    the    cord
             in   this   region   (VCn-a).   There   are   fairly   large   NMJs   to   the    vm2    muscles    of    the    vulva    and
             synapses   onto   VCn   (a,   b).   In   the   nerve   ring   the   synapses   tend   to   be   rather   smaller   and    are
             directed   predominantly   to   AVF   (c),   BDU   (d),   AWB   (e,   f),   RIF   (g),   AIZ    (f)    and    AVJ.    Several
             neurons   make    odd    synapses    onto    HSN    but    none    looks    particularly    significant,    except    perhaps
             BDU   (*d),   AVF   (a)   and   also   PLM   (*g),   which   synapses    onto    HSN    near    its    cell    bodies.    The
             processes   of   HSN   have   a   gap   junction   between   them   on   the    dorsal    mid-line    (h)    although    they
             do not terminate at this point.

              IL1  is  a  set  of  six   ciliated   neurons   with   striated   rootlets,   each   of   which   is   one   of   the   two
            component   neurons   of   the   inner   labial   sensilla.   Unlike   IL2,   the   IL1   dendrite    does    not    protrude
            through   the   hole   in   the   socket   cell   to   the   outside.   Processes   of   IL1   run   posteriorly   from   the
            sensilla  in   each   of   the   six   labial   process   bundles.   They   run   into   their   cell   bodies,   which   are
            anterior   to   the   ring;   posteriorly   directed   processes    from    the    cell    bodies    rejoin    the    process
            bundles,   which   pass   down   outside   the   ring,   turn,   and   then   run   anteriorly    near    the    inside    of
            the  ring  (b)   until   the   processes   disperse   in   the   anterior   regions   of   the   neuropile.   Each   of   the
            IL1  processes  runs   for   about   60ø   round   the   ring,   terminating   with   a   gap   junction   to   the   process
            of   the   neighbouring   IL1   (c,   d);   thus   the   ILls   inhabit   most   of   the   circumference   of   the    ring.
            ILls   are   prominent   motor   neurons   in   the   anterior   regions   of    the    ring    and    form    characteristic
            synaptic    complexes    with    RMD,    URA    and    RIP    (d).    There    are    significant    differences    in    the
            synaptic   partners   of   the    lateral    ILls    (IL1L/R)    from    the    others.    The    main    synaptic    outputs

              IL2  is  a  set   of   six   ciliated   neurons,   each   of   which   is   one   of   the   two   component   neurons   of
            the  six  inner  labial  sensilla.  The   socket   cell   of   each   sensillum   has   a   hole   in   it,   through   which
            the   dendrite   of   IL2   protrudes.   Processes   of   IL2   run   posteriorly   from   the   sensillum   in    each    of
            the  six  labial  process  bundles  and   join   their   cell   bodies,   which   are   situated   anterior   to   the   ring
            neuropile.   Posteriorly   directed   processes   from   the   cell   bodies    rejoin    the    process    bundles,    which
            pass   down   the   outside   of   the   ring,   turn   and   then   run   anteriorly   (a)   until   the   fibres   disperse
            in  the  anterior  regions  of   the   neuropile.   Here   they   run   round   the   ring   for   about   60ø   until   they
            are  in  the  vicinity   of   the   neighbouring   IL2.   Thus   the   processes   of   all   the   IL2   inhabit   most   of
            the  circumference  of   the   ring.   There   are   some   differences   in   the   synaptic   partners   of   the   lateral
            IL2   (i.e.   IL2L/R)   from   the   others.   The   main   synaptic   outputs   of   IL2D/V   are    to    RIP    (a,    b),
            IL1D/V,   RME   (c),   URA    (a),    RIH    (c)    and    OLQ.;    the    main    synaptic    outputs    of    IL2L/R    are
            to   OLQ.   (d),    RIH    (d),    ADE    and    RME.    IL2L/R    also    have    occasional    dark-cored    vesicles    in
            their synapses (d) and have gap junctions with RMG and URX.

              LUA   is   a   set   of   two   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   in   the   lumbar   ganglia.    Anteriorly
            directed   processes    leave    the    cell    bodies    and    enter    the    pre-anal    ganglion    via    the    lumbar
            commissures  (e).  The  processes  of   LUA   run   in   the   ventral   regions   of   the   neuropile   of   the   pre-anal
            ganglion   and   terminate   at   the   anterior   end   of   the   ganglion.   LUA    is    quite    synaptically    active;
            its   main   postsynaptic   partners   are   AVA   (a,   b,   c)   and   AVD   (a).   There   are   also   a   few   synapses
            to   PVC   (b)   and   AVJ   (c).   LUA   receives   some   synaptic   input    from    AVA    (a)    and    possibly    AVD.
            There    are    distinctive    gap    junctions    between    LUA    and    PLM    in    the    lumbar    commissures     (d)
            and possibly a gap junction to AVA in the pre-anal ganglion.

              OLL is a set of two neurons with ciliated  endings  in  the  lateral  outer  labial  sensilla.  Cell
            bodies are  situated  anteriorly  to  the  nerve  ring  and  have  anteriorly  directed  processes  to
            the ciliated endings, which run in the  two  lateral  labial  process  bundles.  Posteriorly  directed
            processes from the cell bodies rejoin the process bundles,  which  initially  run  along  the  outside
            of the nerve ring but then turn and run anteriorly near  the  inner  surface.  The  processes  of  OLL
            bifurcate near the anterior surface of the  ring;  the  dorsal  and  ventral  branches  run  in  close
            association with the  processes  of  AVE  and  terminate  with  gap  junctions  to  their  symmetrical
            partners  on  the  dorsal  and  ventral  (b)  mid-lines.  The  main  synaptic  output  of  OLL  is  to
            SMD (c)  and  to  various  dyadic  combinations  of  AVE  (a,  b),  RIB  (a,  b),  RMD  (d)  and  CEP.
            The main  synaptic  input  is  from  CEP  (*f);  there  are  also  a  few  synapses  from  ADE.  There
            are gap junctions to RIG (*f) and IL1.

                OLQ.   is   a   set   of   four   neurons   with   ciliated   endings   and   striated   rootlets   in   the   dorsal   and
              ventral   outer   labial   sensilla.   Cell   bodies   are   situated   anterior    to    the    nerve    ring    and    have
              anteriorly  directed  processes  to   the   endings   (h,   i),   which   run   in   four   of   the   six   labial   process
              bundles.   Posteriorly   directed   processes   from   the    cell    bodies    rejoin    the    process    bundles,    which
              run  along  the  outside  of  the   nerve   ring   and   then   turn   and   run   anteriorly   near   its   inner   surface.
              The processes of OLQ. enlarge at this point and wrap round the other processes of the bundle

                                      OL%

            (b).   They   become   small   as   they   pass   anteriorly   through    the    NMJ    complex    made    by    IL1,    URA
            and  so  on   (c),   and   then   enlarge   again   and   run   ventrally   on   the   anterior   surface   of   the   nerve
            ring,   in   close   association   with   the   processes   of   RIH,   until   they   terminate.    The    main    synaptic
            output  is   to   RIC   (a);   although   there   is   only   one   of   these   synapses   from   each   OLQ.,   they   are
            large.  There   is   also   synaptic   output   to   RMD   (b)   and   SIB   (b),   usually   in   a   dyadic   combination,
            and   also   occasionally   to   RIH   (d).   The   main   synaptic   input   is   from   CEP    (*e),    IL2    (*d)    and
            RIH   (*c).   There   are   gap   junctions   to   URB   (e),   CEe   (e),   RIG   (f),    RIH    (g),    RIB    (*c)    and
            RMD.

           Member: PDA.
             PDA is a single  motoneuron  that  innervates  posterior  dorsal  body  muscles.  Its  cell  body  is
           situated at the posterior end  of  the  pre-anal  ganglion  and  has  a  large  amoeboid  nucleus  (d).
           A process leaves the cell  body  and  runs  round  to  the  dorsal  cord  via  the  right  hand  lumbar
           commissure (e). This  process  then  runs  anteriorly  for  some  distance  in  the  dorsal  cord  (the
           location of  its  end  point  has  not  been  determined),  PDA  has  few  synaptic  contacts;  in  the
           ventral  cord  and  the  commissure  region,  there  is  a  triadic  synapse  to   PVN,   DA0   and   a
           hypodermal cell (c), and in the dorsal  cord  there  are  a  couple  of  NMJs  (a)  and  a  synapse  to
           DD0 (b). PDA receives a single, but fairly prominent, synapse from DVB.

            posteriorly,   in   a   sub-ventral   location   adjacent   to   the   right   ventral   muscle   (b),    nearly    to    the
            end  of   the   tail.   Here   it   turns   and   runs   anteriorly   in   a   mid-dorsal   location   (e),   becoming   part
            of   the   dorsal   cord   (the   anterior   end   point   in   the   dorsal   cord   has   not   been    determined).    The

           Members: PDEL, PDER.
             PDE is a pair of neurons with ciliated endings in the posterior deirid  sensilla.  The  cell  bodies
           of PDE are situated  sub-ventrally  in  the  posterior  body  (e).  Dorsally  directed  processes  run
           up to the sensilla, which are not in the alae,  as  are  those  of  ADE,  but  dorsal  to  them,  next
           to the sub-dorsal muscles (c). Ventrally  directed  processes  leave  the  cell  body  and  enter  the
           ventral cord via a commissure, where they split  and  run  both  anteriorly  and  posteriorly  in  the
           ventral region of the cord. PDE neurons have been shown to contain dopamine (Sulston et al.
           1975). The main synaptic output is to DVA  (a,  b)  and  AVK  (b);  there  are  also  a  few  synapses
           to hypodermal cells. The main  synaptic  input  is  from  PVM  (*g),  and  there  is  also  some  from
           PLM (*e) and AVK (*c). There are gap junctions to itself (d), PVC and PVM.

             PHA is a set of two ciliated neurons that  are  components  of  the  phasmid  sensilla.  Posteriorly
           directed  processes  emanate  from  each  cell  body  in  the  lumbar  ganglia  and  terminate  in   a
           cilium. The basal body of the cilium is ventral to that of  PHB,  which  is  also  part  of  the  same
           sensillum. Anteriorly directed processes enter  the  pre-anal  ganglion  via  the  lumbar  commissures
           and run near the middle of the neuropile for the  length  of  the  ganglion  (e).  The  main  synaptic
           output is to PHB  (c),  AVG  (a,  d),  PVQ  (b),  itself  (d),  DVA  (a),  AVF  and  AVH,  usually  in
           various dyadic combinations. PHA also has gap junctions to PVP (d) and itself.

              PHB is a set of two ciliated neurons  that  are  components  of  the  phasmid  sensilla.  Posteriorly
            directed  processes  emanate  from  each  cell  body  in  the  lumbar  ganglia  and  terminate   in   a
            cilium. The basal body of the cilium is dorsal to  that  of  PHA,  which  is  also  part  of  the  same
            sensillum. Anteriorly directed processes  enter  the  pre-anal  ganglion  via  the  lumbar  commissures
            and run near the middle of the  neuropile  for  the  length  of  the  ganglion  (e).  The  synapses  of
            PHB  are  generally  rather  larger  than  those  of  PHA.  The  predominant  synaptic  output  is   to
            AVA and PVC  at  dyadic  synapses  (a,  b).  There  are~  also  synapses  to  AVD  (c)  and  VA12  (b).
            There  are  several  gap  junctions  to  itself  (d)  and  a  small  gap  junction  to  AVH.  The  main
            synaptic input is from PHA (*c).

              PHC is a set  of  two  neurons  with  cell  bodies  situated  in  the  lumbar  ganglia.  Posteriorly
            directed processes run from the cell bodies into the tailspike (e)  running  alongside  the  processes
            of  PLM  and  PLN.  The  disposition  of  these  processes  suggests  that   they   may   be   sensory
            dendrites. Anteriorly directed processes leave the cell body  and  enter  the  pre-anal  ganglion  via
            the lumbar commissures and run for a short distance near the middle of the neuropile before
            ending.  The  main  synaptic  output  is  to  DVA  (c):,  PVC  (a)  and  DA9   (a).   There   are   gap
            junctions to itself (d), VAI2 and DA9.

               PVC  is   a   pair   of   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   in   the   lumbar   ganglia.   Processes   leave
             the   cell   bodies,   enter   the   nerve-cord   via   the    lumbar    commissures    and    run    anteriorly    on    the
             right-hand   side   of   the   hypodermal   ridge,   in   the   ventral   region   of   the   cord.    The    processes    of
             PVC   travel   the   length   of   the   cord   and   enter   the   nerve   ring,   running   right   round   it   near   the
             middle   of   the   neuropile   and   eventually   ending   ventrally.   While   in    the    ring,    the    processes    of
             PVC   run   in   close   association   with   each   other   and   with   those   of   AVB.   In   the   nerve   ring,    the
             main   synaptic   output   is   to   AVB   (a,   b,   c,   d),   RID   (d)   and   AVD   (c).   There   are   also   a    few
             synapses   to   AVA   and   AVE   (a).   The   main    synaptic    input    is    from    PVP    (*a),    ALM    (*b),    AVM
             (*a),  AVJ  (*a)  and  AQR  (*a);  there   are   also   gap   junctions   to   itself   and   AVJ   (h).   In   the   ventral
             cord,   the   main   synaptic   output   is   to   AVA   (f),   and   to   VBn   (e)   and   DBn   (e)    motoneurons;    the
             main   synaptic   input    is    from    AVA    (*b),    PHB    (*a),    PHC    (*a),    VA12    (*d),    LUA    (*b),    PVM
             (*h),   PVN   (*c),   DVA   (*f)   and   PVD   (*a);    there    are    gap    junctions    to    AVA    (g),    PVW    (*d),
             PLM (*h), AVJ, PDE and itself.
               In  the   ventral   cord,   the   processes   of   PVC   run   adjacent   and   ventral   to   the   processes   of   AVA;
             the   processes   of   AVB   run   more   dorsally,    seldom    running    next    to    those    of    PVC.    This    may
             explain   why   there   are   so   few   synaptic   interactions   with   AVB   in   the   nerve    cord    compared    with
             the nerve ring.

              PVD   is   a   set   of   two   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   laterally   in   the    posterior    body.
            Anteriorly    and    posteriorly    directed    processes    leave    the    cell    bodies    and    run    alongside    the
            excretory   canal   in   close   association   with   the   processes   of   ALA   and    GAN.    These    three    processes
            have    not    been    completely    reconstructed    in    the    posterior    body,     although     they     have     been
            sampled  in  several  places.  Two  of  the  processes  end  at   about   the   level   of   the   anus;   a   third   enters
            the    lumbar    ganglia    and    synapses    onto    PVC    (ALA-d).    A     single     synapse     on     the     lateral
            hypodermis   has   also   been   seen   on   one   of   the   processes   (CAN-c).   PVD   neurons   send   out   a    third,
            ventrally   directed   process,   which   enters   the   ventral    cord    as    a    commissure.    This    process    runs
            anteriorly   in   the   ventral   part   of   the   cord   and   has   several   dyadic   synapses    to    AVA    and    PVC
            (a). There are also a few synapses to DVA (b).

               PVN    is    a    set    of    two    interneurons/motoneurons    with    cell    bodies    situated    in    the    lumbar
             ganglia.   Anteriorly    directed    processes    enter    the    pre-anal    ganglion    via    the    lumbar    commissures
             and   then   run   alongside   each   other    near    the    centre    of    the    ventral    cord.    Prominent    lateral
             branches   enter    the    anterior    regions    of    the    vulva    (e),    running    underneath    the    vml    vulval
             muscles.   These   branches   become   quite    large    and    contain    a    few    vesicles,    although    no    obvious
             focal   synaptic   contacts   have   been   seen.   The   processes   of    PVN    also    branch    extensively    in    the
             anterior   extremities   of   the   ventral   cord;   PVN   is   the   most   highly   branched   class    of    neuron    in
             the nervous system. Many of the branches probably develop quite late, as PVN neurons in the
             JSH series (an L4 larva) had few branches. The branches of PVN tend to stay in the same
             neighbourhood     as     the     main     processes,     running     alongside     them     (they     have     been     drawn
             separated   for   clarity).   The   main   processes   of   both   PVNL    and    PVNR    enter    the    nerve    ring    on
             the  right-hand  side  and  run  round  it   near   the   inside   surface   of   the   neuropile,   in   close   association
             with   the   processes   of   BDU.   PVNL   has   an   additional   branch,   which   enters   the   ring   on   the    left-
             hand   side,   travelling   in   the   same   neighbourhood   as    the    other    branches    of    PVN.    The    synapses
             that  are  made  by  PVN  are   all   rather   small,   with   few   vesicles   in   their   synaptic   terminals.   In   the
             nerve  ring  there  are   a   few   synapses   to   and   from   BDU   (a,   *c)   and   to   AVJ   (b).   In   the   ventral
             cord   the   synapses   are   more    numerous    and    are    mainly    onto    AVD,    NMJs    (d),    VDn,    DDn    (d),
             AVJ   and    PVW.    There    is    a    single    gap    junction    to    both    HSN    and    PVQ.,    and    a    couple
             to AVB.

             Members: PVPL, PVPR.
               PVP is a pair of neurons with cell bodies situated  in  the  pre-anal  ganglion.  Processes  project
             anteriorly from the cell bodies, cross over (j), and then run up  the  ventral  cord  on  either  side
             of the hypodermal ridge. The processes of  PVP  then  enter  the  nerve  ring  and  run  round  either
             side of it, in the middle of the neuropile,  until  they  meet  and  terminate  with  a  gap  junction
             and vesicle-filled swellings on the dorsal mid-line  (g).  The  processes  in  the  ring  seem  to  be
             closely associated with AVB; they  also  vary  considerably  in  diameter.  In  the  nerve  ring,  the
             main synaptic output  is  to  AVB  (a,  d),  PVC  (a),  RIG  (b),  AVA  (c),  AVH  (c)  and  there  is
             some synaptic input  from  RIF  (*c)  and  AVH.  In  the  ventral  cord,  there  are  a  few  synapses
             onto  the  hypodermis  (f)  and  AVL  (e);  there  are  many  gap  junctions  to  AQR  and  DVC   (*d)
             and a few to PQR (*h), PHA (*d), AVK and VDn (h).

            Members' PVQL, PVQR.
              PVQ.   is   a   pair   of   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   in   the   lumbar   ganglia.    Processes    enter    the
            posterior    extremity    of    the    ventral    cord    via    the    lumbar    commissures;    initially,     both     run
            anteriorly   on   the   right-hand   side    of    the    hypodermal    ridge.    When    the    end    of    the    pre-anal
            ganglion   is   reached,   PVQL   crosses   over   to   the   left-hand   side   of   the   hypodermal   ridge    and    runs
            all   the   way   along   the   ventral   cord   up   to   the   nerve   ring   in   this   position,   whereas   PVQR   runs
            on  the  right-hand  side  along   with   most   of   the   processes   of   the   ventral   cord   (figure   15).   As   the
            ring  is  approached,   the   processes   move   up   to   the   dorsal   surface   of   the   neuropile   of   the   ventral
            ganglion.  The  processes   then   run   round   each   side   of   the   ring,   near   the   posterior   face,   in   close
            association   with   the   processes   of   ASJ.   They   meet   and   terminate    on    the    dorsal    mid-line;    there
            is  a  gap  junction  at  the  point  of   contact   on   the   JSH   series   but   the   two   processes   do   not   quite
            touch   on   the   N2U   series.   The   processes   of   PVQ.   have   prominent   lateral   (b,   c)   and    dorsal    (d)
            vesicle-filled varicosities. There are many dark vesicles present in these regions; the rest of the

            240                                                              PVQ,

            cytoplasm     stains     rather     lightly,     giving     the     processes     of     PVO     a     characteristic     appearance     (BDU
            looks    similar    but    has    smaller    processes    with    fewer    vesicles).    The    main    synaptic    output    is    to    AIA
            (a,    b,    c,    d),    sometimes    in    dyadic    combination    with    ASK    (b,    c).    There    are    also    a    few     minor
            synapses    to    AVF    and    HSN.    The    synaptic    input    is    almost    exclusively    from    ASJ    (*a),    in    the    nerve
            ring.    There    are    gap    junctions    to    ASK    (*a,    b)    and    ADA.    There    are    practically     no     synapses     of
            any    consequence    in    the    ventral    cord,    except    possibly    for    a    few    synapses    from    PHA    (*b)    in     the
            tail.

              PVR   has   a   cell   body   situated   in   the   right    lumbar    ganglion.    A    posteriorly    directed    process
            runs  to  nearly  the  end  of  the   tailspike   (e);   this   observation   suggests   that   it   could   be   a   sensory
            dendrite.   An    anteriorly    directed    process    enters    the    pre-anal    ganglion    via    the    right    lumbar
            commissure   and   has   a   gap   junction   with   PLMR   as   it   crosses   its   process.   It   runs   anteriorly    up
            the   ventral   cord   near   the   ventral   extremity   of   the   process   bundle.   The   process   then   enters    the
            right-hand  side  of   the   nerve   ring   and   runs   right   round   it   in   an   anticlockwise   direction,   adjacent
            to  the  inner   surface   of   the   neuropile,   and   ends   in   the   left   ventral   region   of   the   ring.   Small
            branches   project   anteriorly   from   the   process   at   each   quadrant   and   run    in    the    middle    of    the
            process   bundles   from    the    labial    sensory    receptors    (ILl-b).    No    synapses    are    seen    on    these
            branches.  Dark-staining  regions   are   present   in   the   basal   lamina   on   the   inner   surface   of   the   ring,
            adjacent  to  the  process  of   PVR,   in   a   few   places   (d).   The   main   synaptic   output   is   in   the   nerve
            ring   and   is   directed   to   AVB   (a),   RIP   (a,   c)   and   AVJ   (b).   There   is   a   gap   junction   to   ALM
            (*d).   In   the   ventral   cord   there   is   some   synaptic   input   from    AVM,    DVA    and    PVM,    and    there
            are gap junctions to DVA and PLMR.

            Member: PVT.
              PVT has a large cell body, situated in the pre-anal  ganglion,  which  sends  out  a  fairly  large,
            anteriorly directed process that  runs  near  the  middle  of  the  ventral  cord  (b).  This  process
            presumably terminates somewhere in the  posterior  body,  as  it  does  not  seem  to  be  present  in
            the anterior ventral cord.  No  synaptic  outputs  have  been  seen  from  this  neuron.  It  receives
            some synaptic input from PVN (a) and PVW ( * a) ;,. there is also a gap junction to PVP (c).

               PVW    is    a    set    of    two    interneurons    with    cell    bodies    situated    in    the    lumbar    ganglia.     Anteriorly
             directed     processes     enter     the     pre-anal     ganglia      via      the      lumbar      commissures      and      then      run
             alongside    each    other    near    the    centre    of    the    process    bundle    of    the    ventral     cord,     adjacent     and
             ventral    to    the    processes    of    PVN.    The    processes    of    PVW     end     somewhere     in     the     posterior     body
             regions,    although    the    exact    point    has    not    been    located.    PVW    makes    a    few    rather     small     synapses
             in    the    cord,    each    having    only    a    few    synaptic    vesicles.    The    main    postsynaptic    partners     are     PVT
             (a, b) and possibly AVD (c); there are gap junctions to PVC (d).

            Members' RIAL, RIAR.
              RIA is a set of two prominent interneurons  with  cell  bodies  situated  in  the  lateral  ganglia,
            adjacent to the  neuropile  of  the  nerve  ring.  Large  processes  enter  the  nerve  ring  directly
            sub-dorsally and run round the ring initially near the posterior face  and  enter  the  ventral  cord.
            They  loop  round  into  the  neuropile  of  the  ventral  ganglion  and  re-enter  the  ring  on  the
            ipsilateral side (g). They then run round the nerve ring  near  the  anterior  surface  and  in  close
            association with the processes of  their  contralateral  partners  and  the  processes  of  RMD  which
            often surround them (*d). RIA is presynaptic only on the  distal  regions  of  its  processes  in  the
            nerve  ring,  which  have  many  synapses  (f).  It  synapses  onto   SMD   (a)   and   RMD   (e)   at
            numerous sites in these  regions.  There  are  also  a  few  synapses  to  RIV  (b).  SMD  and  RMDL/R
            (but  not  RMDD/V)  synapse  back  onto  RIA  reciprocally.  Often  reciprocal  pairs   are   adjacent
            (d, e). RIA is one of the major integrating neurons in the nerve  ring;  it  receives  synaptic  input
            from  ADF  (*a),  SMD  (d),  RMDL/R  (e),  AIZ  (*a),  RIH  (*a),  AIY  (*e),  AUA  (*a),  BAG   (*a),
            AOR   (*d),   URX   (*a),   RIR   (*a),   RIB   (*f),   ASH   (*d),   AWB   (*b)   and    RIV    (*e).
            Characteristic structures are seen in the neuropile  of  the  ventral  ganglion,  where  RIA  receives
            synapses from AIZ and AIY (c).

             RIB  is  a   set   of   two   interneurons   with   cell   bodies   in   the   lateral   ganglia.   Processes   enter   the
           ventral    cord    via    the    amphidial    commissures    and    project    anteriorly,    running    in    the    ventral
           regions  of   the   cord.   AIY   often   wraps   round   the   processes   of   RIB   in   the   region   of   the   ventral
           ganglion  (e).  Processes  enter  the  ring   and   run   round   it   near   the   outside   surface   and   the   posterior
           face,   eventually   meeting   and   stopping   at   the    dorsal    mid-line    with    a    gap    junction    to    their
           contralateral   partners   (a).   There   are   two   branch    points    situated    near    the    sub-dorsal    and    the
           sub-ventral   process   bundles    from    the    labial    sensilla;    dorsally    and    ventrally    directed    branches
           from   these   points   run,   closely   associated   with   the   processes   of   AVE,   in   the   anterior   regions   of
           the   nerve   ring.   These   processes   terminate   with   gap   junctions   to    their    contralateral    partners    on
           the   dorsal   (b)   and   ventral   (d)   mid-lines.   There   are   also   laterally   situated   gap   junctions   between
           processes   of   the   same   cell   (c).   The   main   synaptic   outputs   are    to    AVE    (h),    RIA    (f),    AIB,
           AIZ   (h)   and   AVA   (g)   but   the   synapses   are   generally   rather   small.   The   main   synaptic   inputs   are
           from'   OLL   (*a),   AUA   (*a),   AIY   (*e),   BAG   (*a),    RIG    (*d),    AIN    (*c),    AIB    (*a),    RIS    (*c),
           RIH   (*b)   and   URY.   RIB   is   unusual   as   it   has   gap   junctions   to   many    other    classes    of    cell;
           these are OLQ. (c), AVB (g), RIG (*g), SIB (*c), SIA (*a), SMB, DVB and SMD.

              RIC is a pair of interneurons with cell bodies situated in the  posterior  regions  of  the  lateral
            ganglia. Processes leave the cell body and enter the  ventral  cord  via  the  amphidial  commissures.
            Here they turn and run  anteriorly  into  the  nerve  ring  running  on  the  dorsal  surface  of  the
            neuropile. When they enter the  nerve  ring  they  move  to  the  middle  of  the  neuropile  and  run
            right round the nerve ring; the distal regions of each  process  running  in  close  association  with
            the proximal  regions  of  the  process  of  its  contralateral  partner.  Short  anteriorly  directed
            branches come off  each  process  sub-ventrally  and  sub-dorsally  on  the  contralateral  side.  The
            main synaptic output is to AVA  (a,  b,  c),  SMD  (a),  and  SMBD  (b).  There  are  some  dark-cored
            vesicles present in the pre-synaptic  terminals  (a).  The  main  synaptic  input  is  from  CEP  (*a)
            and OLQ.  (*a);  there  are  also  some  inputs  from  U'RB  (*d)  and  URX.  RIC  has  gap  junctions
            to ASH and AVK (d).

               RID is a  single  motoneuron  that  innervates  dorsal  body  muscles.  Its  cell  body  is  situated
             in the dorsal ganglion on the dorsal  mid-line.  A  single  process  emanates  from  the  ventral  side
             of the cell body and runs down one side of the nerve ring and  enters  the  neuropile  of  the  ventral
             ganglion. In the N2U series, this process was on  the  left-hand  side;  in  the  JSH  series,  it  ran
             to the right. The process  then  leaves  the  ventral  cord  via  the  amphidial  commissure  and  runs
             round to the dorsal cord. Here it  meets  a  short  process  that  has  come  directly  from  the  cell
             body and has a  gap  junction  with  it  (d).  RID  probably  runs  along  the  length  of  the  dorsal
             cord. It has not been followed for the whole  length  but  its  process  has  been  identified  in  the
             posterior regions of the cord on the  basis  of  the  morphology  of  its  synapses.  RID  has  a  few,
             rather small, synapses, which are all in  the  dorsal  cord.  These  are  mainly  to  hypodermal  cells
             (a), DDn motor neurons  (b)  and  dorsal  muscles.  The  synaptic  input  is  from  PVC  in  the  nerve
             ring. Gap junctions are made to AVB (c) and ALA (*c).

             Processes  run  anteriorly   from   the   cell   bodies   and   run   in   the   interior   of   the   ventral   nerve   cord
             symmetrically   disposed   about   the   mid-line.   They   move   to   the   dorsal   surface   of   the   cord    as    the
             ring  is   approached   and   then   run   round   either   side   of   the   ring   on   the   inside   surface   near   the
             posterior  face.   The   processes   of   RIF   meet   and   terminate   on   the   dorsal   mid-line   but   do   not   have
             a   gap   junction.   The   main   synaptic   output    is    to    AVB    in    dyadic    combination    with    RIM    (a),
             AVJ   (b),   PVP   (c)   or   ALM   (d).   The   main   synaptic   input   is   from   AIA   (*a)    via    large    synapses
             in   the   neuropile   of   the   ventral   ganglion.   There   is   also   some    synaptic    input    from    HSN    (*g).
             A   short   process   from   AVG   (*b)   often   pokes   into   the   cell   body   of   one   of   the   RIFs.   AVG    has
             gap junctions with both RIFs.

              RIG is a set of two  interneurons  with  cell  bodies  situated  in  the  retro-vesicular  ganglion.
            Processes from each cell body run anteriorly, closely apposed in  the  middle  of  the  ventral  cord.
            As they approach the nerve ring, the processes  move  down  into  the  ventral  region  of  the  nerve
            cord. They then enter the nerve ring and run round each  side  of  it,  near  the  anterior  face  and
            outside surface of the neuropile, until they  meet  and  terminate  on  the  dorsal  mid-line  with  a
            gap  junction.  The  main  synaptic  output  is  to  RIR  (a),  RMH  (b),  AVE  (c),  AIZ   (c),   AVK
            (b), RIB (d) and BAG (d). There  are  extensive  synaptic  inputs  from  ADE  (*a)  in  the  neuropile
            of the ventral ganglion and some synapses from DVC (*a), PVP (*b), URX (*d), BAG (*b)
            and DVB in the nerve ring.  RIG  is  striking  because  of  the  quantity  and  diversity  of  its  gap
            junctions. It has gap junctions with itself (e), URY (c, h), OLQ (*f), OLL (f), RIB (g), BAG
            (h), AQR and AVK.

            Member: RIH.
              RIH  is  an   interneuron   with   a   single,   large,   cell   body   situated   on   the   ventral   mid-line   at   the
            anterior   end   of   the   ventral   ganglion   (figure   10).   A   process   comes   off   the   cell   body   posteriorly
            and   then   turns   and   runs   ventrally   to   the   ventral   extremity    of    the    neuropile.    It    then    runs
            anteriorly  in  this   position   until   it   bifurcates   with   each   process   running   round   the   outside   surface
            of   the   nerve   ring.   These    two    processes    appear    symmetrical;    however,    the    left-hand    one    ends
            after   a   short   distance   and   the   right-hand   process   changes   direction    and    runs    anteriorly    through
            the  neuropile  of  the   nerve   ring   until   it   reaches   the   anterior   surface.   At   this   point   the   process
            bifurcates   again   and   each   branch   runs   round   the   ring   and   ends   near    the    dorsal    mid-line.    The
            unusual   architecture   of    this    neuron    results    in    its    processes'    inhabiting    two    quite    separate
            neighbourhoods.   The   main   synaptic   outputs   after   the   first   bifurcation   are   to    RIA    (a),    AIZ    (a)
            and   RIB   (b)   at   dyadic   synapses.   After   the   second    bifurcation,    the    main    synaptic    outputs    are
            to   RIP   (c),   OLQ.   (c),   at   dyadic   synapses,   and   CEP.   The   main   synaptic   input   is   from   IL2   (*c,
            *d). RIH has gap junctions with ADF (d), CEP, OLQ. (*g) and FLP (*d).
              Magnifications: (a) x25500, (b-d) x 17000.

            RIM is a set of two  motoneurons  that  innervate  muscles  in  the  head  via  NMJs  in  the  nerve
          ring. The cell bodies are situated in the lateral ganglia and send processes  into  the  ventral  cord
          via  the  amphidial  commissures.  These  run  anteriorly  through  the  neuropile  of   the   ventral
          ganglion and then make one complete circuit  round  the  anterior  regions  of  the  nerve  ring  near
          the outside surface. They are closely associated with the  processes  of  AIB  for  most  of  the  way
          round the ring. RIM is the only  motoneuron  class  in  the  nerve  ring  that  does  not  have  axons
          situated on the inner surface of the nerve ring and  so  is  only  accessible  to  muscle  arms  where
          they penetrate the ring at  the  four  muscle  spurs  (figure  14).  Large  NMJs  are  formed  on  the
          anterior side of each of the muscle spurs (a) and  are  usually  intercepted  by  dendrites  from  RMD
          motoneurons  (d).  The  processes  of  RIM  and  RMD  form  characteristic   structures,   which   are
          seen just anterior to  the  NMJ  region  in  each  quadrant,  where  the  RMD  process  flattens  into
          a sheet and covers the anterior surface  of  a  varicosity  in  the  RIM  process  near  the  NMJ  (b,
          c). The  main  neuron  classes  that  are  postsynaptic  to  RIM  are'  RMD  (d),  SAA  (g),  SMD  (e)
          and AVB (f). The main  synaptic  inputs  are  from  AIB  (*a),  AIZ  (*g),  SAA  (*b)  and  RIS  (*b).
          There are several gap junctions to AVE (h) and some to AVA, RIS and AIY (*d).

            The RIP interneurons mediate the only direct interconnections between the pharyngeal and
            the central nervous systems. They have two laterally situated cell bodies immediately anterior
            to the nerve ring. A dorsally directed process emanates from each cell body and runs round
            the anterior surface of the ring neuropile to the contralateral side. These processes then turn
            and run anteriorly, in the lateral labial process bundles, finally entering the pharynx near its
            anterior extremity (d). The processes from RIP end soon after entering the pharynx with a
            gap junction to the I1 interneurons of the pharyngeal nervous system (Albertson & Thomson
            I976). A dorsal and a ventrally directed process leave each cell body, run round the anterior
            surface of the ring and then enter the ring neuropile sub-dorsally and sub-ventrally. Here, the
            processes fan out into dendrites, which intercept NMJs from URA (*a) and IL1 (*e). The
            central part of each process carries on running posteriorly in the centre of the bundle of
            processes from the labial sensory neurons (b) and eventually peters out. No obvious chemical
            synapses are made by RIP, although what appear to be presynaptic specializations with no
            synaptic vesicles are present adjacent to OLQ. neurons on the dorsal side of the ring (+ and
            a). The main synaptic inputs are from IL1 (*e), URA (*a), IL2 (*a), RIH (*c) and PVR
            (*c). There are gap junctions to RMED (c) ventrally.

              RIR   is   an   interneuron   with   a   single   cell   body   in   the   ventral   ganglion.   An   anteriorly   directed
            process  leaves  the  cell   body   and   runs   on   the   dorsal   surface   of   the   nerve   cord   on   the   mid-line.
            As   the   nerve   ring   is   approached   this   process   abruptly   turns    and    moves    down    to    the    ventral
            surface  of  the  nerve  cord.  At   this   point,   it   divides   into   two   processes   (b),   which   run   round   the
            nerve   ring   near   the   middle   of   the   neuropile   and   terminate   near   the    dorsal    mjd-line    (d).    The
            main   synaptic   outputs   of   RIR   are   to   RIA   (a),   AIZ   (c)   and   URX   (a).   The   main   synaptic    inputs
            are from AVH (*a), RIG (*a), ADF and DVA (*e). There are gap junctions to BAG (*d).

               RIS is an interneuron with a single cell  body  situated  on  the  right-hand  side  of  the  ventral
             ganglion behind the excretory duct. A single, fairly large  process  leaves  the  cell  body  and  runs
             anteriorly on the dorsal  surface  of  the  nerve  cord.  A  short  branch  dips  down  into  the  body
             of the nerve cord and makes  a  very  characteristic  gap  junction  to  AVJ  (*c).  The  main  process
             runs in the middle of the dorsal surface of the  nerve  cord  until  the  nerve  ring  is  reached.  It
             then runs round the  nerve  ring  in  an  anticlockwise  direction,  running  near  the  anterior  face
             and  outside  surface.  The  right-  and  left-hand  regions  of  the   process   appear   symmetrical,
             although  they  are  running  in  opposite  directions  with  respect  to  the  cell  body.  The   main
             synaptic  outputs  are  to  AVE  (a),  RIM  (b),  RMD  (d),  RIB  (c),  CEP  (a)   and   AVK,   usually
             in various dyadic  and  triadic  combinations.  There  is  not  much  synaptic  input;  what  there  is
             comes  mainly  from  SDQ.  and  PVC.  Gap  junctions   are   made   to   AVJ   (*c),   SMD,   RIM   and
             AIB.

              RIV  is  a  pair  of  interneurons/motoneurons  with  cell  bodies  situated  sub-dorsally  in   the
            lateral ganglia. Processes from each cell body enter  the  ring  sub-dorsally,  cross  over  to  the
            contralateral side of the ring, and then run round it in  the  middle  of  the  neuropile  until  they
            meet at the ventral mid-line in the  anterior  region  of  the  neuropile  of  the  ventral  ganglion.
            At this point the processes turn round and  run  dorsally  along  the  inside  surface  of  the  nerve
            ring, eventually ending laterally. Small projections at the  region  of  contact  run  anteriorly  and
            posteriorly from each process adjacent to  the  basal  lamina  on  the  inside  of  the  ring.  Darkly
            staining regions adjacent to the lamina  are  seen  near  the  ends  of  these  projections  (b).  The
            main  synaptic  outputs  are  to  SAAD  via  fairly  prominent  monadic  synapses  (a,  e)  and   NMJs
            (c, d). There are also smaller  synapses  to  RMD  (d),  SMD  (d),  SIA  (f)  and  RIA  (e).  All  the
            synaptic outputs are in the ventral region of the nerve  ring.  The  main  synaptic  inputs  are  from
            RIA (*b). Gap junctions are made to SDQ (a, e), SMD (g), AIB (h) and to itself (e).

               RMD is a  set  of  six  major  motoneurons,  which  innervate  muscles  in  the  head  via  NMJs  in
             the nerve ring. The cell bodies of  RMDV  and  RMD  are  situated  in  the  lateral  ganglia  adjacent
             to the ring neuropile; those of RMDD  are  in  the  ventral  ganglion  (figure  1O).  Processes  enter
             the nerve ring laterally in  the  case  of  RMDV  (j)  and  RMDL/R  (o),  and  via  the  ventral  cord
             in the case of  RMDD  (i),  and  run  round  the  ring  for  three  quadrants.  The  proximal  regions
             of these processes run closely associated together and are also closely  associated  with,  and  often
             surround, the processes ofRIA (d). The processes of this group run  in  the  middle  of  the  anterior
             regions of the neuropile of  the  ring.  The  distal  regions  of  each  of  the  RMD  processes  move
             towards the  inside  surface  of  the  ring,  where  they  have  their  NMJs.  RMDD  wraps  round  the
             process  of  CEPD  in  a  characteristic  manner  (g).  The  main  regions  of  synaptic   input   are
             diametrically opposite the regions of NMJs (the NMJs present on the left-hand side of RMDL
                                           .
             are atypical and have  not  been  seen  on  the  other  reconstructed  series).  The  NMJs  of  RMDD/V
             are usually  in  a  complex  that  consists  of  NMJs  from  RMD,  IL1  and  URA  and  dendrites  from
             RMD  and  RIP  (a,  b).  Sometimes  the  complex  is  seen  without  the   RIP   and   URA   processes
             (c).  RMDL/R  behave  somewhat  differently  and  could,  possibly,  be  considered  as   a   separate
             class. Most of the NMJs of RMDL/R are  part  of  a  complex,  present  on  each  of  the  four  muscle
             arm  spurs  (figure  14),  in  which  an   RMDL/R   dendrite   is   sandwiched   between   an   RMDL/R
             NMJ  .and  an  RIM  NMJ  (k).  There  are  also  a  few  RMDL/R  NMJs  laterally  that  are  not  part
             of  any  complex  (1).  The  processes  of  RMDL/R  flatten  out  and  form  caps  over  the  anterior
             surfaces of the NMJ  regions  of  RIM,  which  are  situated  directly  anterior  to  the  muscle  arm
             spurs  (m,  RIM-*b,  RIM-*c).  The  main  synaptic  outputs   of   RMDL/R   are   onto   contralateral
             RMDL/Rs  (as  corecipients  at  NMJs)  and  RIA  (n);  the  main  synaptic  inputs  are'   RIA   (*e),
             RIM (m), RMG (*a), IL1, ADE (*c), RMF (*e), contralateral RMDL/Rs, RIS (*d), RMH

            (*a) and OLL (d). There  are  also  gap  junctions  to  RMDD/V,  but  not  to  each  other.  The  only
            synaptic  output  of  RMDD/V,  apart  from  NMJs,   is   to   contralateral   RMDD/Vs   at   the   NMJ
            complexes;  the  main  synaptic  inputs  are  from  RIA   (*f),   URY   (f),   contralateral   RMDD/Vs
            (a, b), IL1  (a,  b),  OLL  (*d),  CEP  (*h),  RIV  (*d)  and  OLQ.  (*b).  There  are  gap  junctions
            to   SAA,   RMDD/V,   SMD,   RMDL/R,   AVE   and   OLQ.    OLQ.    has    an    interesting    comple-
            mentary  synaptic  relation  to  RMDD/V;   OLQD   synapses   onto   RMDD   and   has   gap   junctions
            to   RMDV,   whereas   OLQV   synapses   onto   RMDV   and    has    gap    junctions    with    RMDD.
            Occasionally  the  processes  of  RMDD/V   appear   to   penetrate   the   basal   lamina   separating
            nervous tissue from muscle arms, and have gap junctions directly onto muscle arms (h).

            Members: RMED, RMEV, RMEL, RMER.
              RME   is   a   set   of   four    motoneurons,    with    NMJs    in    the    nerve    ring,    which    innervate    head
            muscles.   The   members   of   this   class   have   an   unusual   fourfold   symmetry;   cell    bodies    are    situated
            mid-dorsally     (RMED),     mid-ventrally     (RMEV),     left      laterally      (RMEL)      and      right      laterally
            (RMER).   Each   cell   has   a   twofold   symmetry   and   sends   out   two   processes,    which    run    in    opposite
            directions    round    the    nerve    ring    near    the    anterior    surface.    These    processes    run     alongside
            processes   of   adjacent   RMEs   and   meet   at   the   distal   side   of   the   nerve    ring,    forming    NMJs    at
            this  point  (d,  e,   fand   figure   14).   This   meeting   point   is   always   located   on   the   mid-line   opposite
            to   that   on   which   the   cell   body   is   located.   RMED/V   each   send   out   an   extra   process;   these   run
            down   the   ventral   and   dorsal   cords   respectively,   for   about   150   gm,   and   then    peter    out    without
            making   any    significant    synaptic    connections    along    their    length.    RMED/V    also    have    two    small
            dendrites,   emanating   from   their   cell   bodies,   which   intercept   the    NMJs    of    SMB    (*e).    The    cell
            bodies   of   all   the   RME   neurons   are   closely   apposed   to   the   nerve   ring    and    are    ensheathed    by
            the   thin   sheet-like   processes   of   the   CEPsh   cells   that   surround   the   neuropile   of   the   nerve    ring
            (c).    RMEL/R    synapse    exclusively    onto    muscle;     RMED/V     synapse     onto     muscle     (a,     b)     but
            probably   also   synapse   onto   adjacent    SMD    processes    (d,    e).    RME    receives    synaptic    input    from
            IL2    (*c),    SMB    (*e)    (RMED/V    only),    OLL    (RMEL/R     only)     and     possibly     URA     (*c).     There
            are   gap   junctions   to   itself,   AVE,   RIP   and   IL1D/V   (*g),    and    prominent    gap    junctions    to    the
            glial   cells,   GLR   (g);   RME   is   the    only    neuron    class    that    makes    contact    with    these    cells
            (figure 15).

            Members:      RMFL, RMFR.
               RMF is    a set of two motoneurons, which innervate head muscles via NMJs in the nerve ring.
            The   cell   bodies   of   RMF   are    situated    in    the    ventral    ganglion    and    send    anteriorly    directed
            processes   into   the   nerve   ring.   These   processes   are   initially   closely   associated   with   those   of   AVA
            (a)   but   then   move   away   from   AVA   in   the   nerve   ring   and   run   right   round   it   near   the   outside
            surface   and   anterior   face.   A   branch   comes   offeach   process   at   a   distal   sub-dorsal   position.    (Only
            one   was   present   in   the   NgU   reconstruction,   but   two   were   seen   in    other    reconstructions,    so    a
            diagram   of   RMF   from   the   JSH   animal    has    been    included).    This    branch    moves    to    the    inside
            surface   of   the   nerve   ring   and   has   NMJs.   The   main   synaptic   outputs   are:   NMJs,   which   are    often
            dyadic   or   triadic   with   RMG   as   a   corecipient   (c);   AVK   (e);   and   RMD   (e).   Some   of   the   synaptic
            vesicles   of   RMF   have   dark-looking    cores    (d).    The    main    synaptic    input    comes    from    DVB    (f)
            and DVC (g). There are gap junctions to RMG (h).

              RMG  is  a  set  of  two  motoneurons,  which  innervate  muscles  in  the  head  via  NMJs  in   the
            nerve ring. The cell bodies of  RMG  are  situated  laterally,  just  behind  the  pharynx,  and  enter
            the ventral cord via the deirid  commissures.  The  processes  run  near  the  dorsal  surface  of  the
            ventral cord and enter  the  nerve  ring,  which  they  run  partly  round,  near  the  inner  surface,
            terminating  sub-dorsally  at  characteristic  structures,  where  they  wrap   round   a   bundle   of
            processes (b). RMG has NMJs on the lateral side of  each  of  the  four  muscle  spurs  (c  and  figure
            14). The synaptic vesicles are large;  some  are  dark-cored  (a).  It  also  has  synaptic  output  to
            RMD  (a)  and  AVE.  The  main  synaptic  input  is   from   ADE,   CEP   and   also,   possibly,   RMF
            via  processes  that  intercept  NMJs  (d).  RMG  has  gap  junctions  with  many  classes   of   cell,
            namely AWB (*d), RMH (*d), RMF (*h), ASK, IL2L/R, ASH, ADL and URX.

              RMH is a set of two  motoneurons  which  innervate  muscles  in  the  head  via  NMJs  in  the  nerve
            ring. The  cell  bodies  of  RMH  are  situated  in  the  ventral  ganglion  and  send  out  anteriorly
            directed processes, which enter the nerve ring and  run  round  it  near  the  inside  surface  to  the
            contralateral  side.  Here  they  form   two   looped   structures   which   have   regions   of   NMJs
            symmetrically disposed about  the  lateral  line.  Some  of  the  NMJs  are  intercepted  by  dendrites
            from RMD (a). The main source  of  synaptic  input  is  from  RIG  (b)  and  CEP  (c).  There  are  gap
            junctions to RMG (d).

              SAA is a set of four interneurons  that  send  processes  anteriorly  up  the  sub-lateral  cords  in
            the head. The cell bodies of  SAAD  are  situated  in  the  ventral  ganglion  (figure  16).  Those  of
            SAAV are situated slightly dorsal of the lateral lines, closely  apposed  to,  and  posterior  to,  the
            neuropile of the nerve ring (h,  i).  The  SAAV  pair  sends  additional  processes  down  the  lateral
            lines (i). These processes run laterally alongside those of FLP for about 20 [tm and then end.

                            SAA                                                                                                                                                297

           The   main   processes   from   the   cell   bodies   of   SAAV   enter    the    ring    sub-dorsally    and    run    round
           it;   they   then   leave   ventrally,   on   the   contralateral   side,   and   enter   the   ventral   cord.   They    run
           posteriorly   for   a   short   distance   in   the   cord   and   leave   via   the   amphidial    commissures    to    take
           up   their   positions   along   with   the   processes   of   SABV   in   the   anterior    ventral    sub-lateral    cords.
           The   SAAD   pair   sends   anteriorly   directed   processes   into   the   ring,   which   run   round   it   until    they
           reach   a   contralateral,   sub-dorsal   position   where   they   turn   and   run    posteriorly    through    the    ring
           neuropile,   and   then   turn   again   to   enter   the   dorsal   sub-lateral   cords    along    with    the    processes
           of   SABD.   Processes   from   SMBD   poke   into   the   cell    bodies    of    SAAV,    where    they    form    chemical
           synapses     (SMB-d).     SMD     cells     wrap     round     the     processes      of      SAA      neurons      ventrally
           (SMD-c,   d).   All   the   SAA   neurons   run    in    close    association    with    the    processes    of    AVA    and
           RIM  in  the   nerve   ring;   their   major   synaptic   outputs   are   to   these   processes   (a,   b)   and   also   to
           those of SMD. RIM synapses back onto the SAA neurons reciprocally (d). SAA has gap
           junctions to RMD. There are several dorsal-ventral asymmetries exhibited by these cells' PLN
           synapses    onto    SAAD     (e)     and     ALN     onto     SAAV;     SMBV     synapses     onto     SAAD     and     makes
           gap   junctions   with   SAAV,    whereas    SMBD    synapses    onto    SAAV    but    makes    a    gap    junction    with
           SAAD    (f).    RIV    (*a)    synapses    only    onto    SAAD,    as    does    VB1,    which     synapses     onto     two
           posteriorly    directed    processes,    which    emanate    from    the    cell    bodies     of     SAAD     (g);     these
           processes end in the retro-vesicular ganglion (h).

              SAB   is   a   set   of   three   interneurons,   which   send   processes   anteriorly   up    thc    sub-lateral    cords
            in   the   head.   All   the   cell   bodies,   which   are   situated   in   the   retro-vesicular   ganglion,   send    out
            anteriorly   directed   processes   which   leave    the    ventral    cord    via    the    amphidial    commissures.    The
            processes   of   SABV   join   the   anterior   sub-ventral   cords   along    with    the    processes    of    SAAV    (e);
            the   process   of   SABD   runs   round   the   right-hand   side   of   the   animal   and    sends    a    process    into
            each   anterior   sub-dorsal   cord   along    with    one    from    SAAD    (d).    No    synaptic    output    has    been
            seen   from   SAB   in   adults;   however,   in   the   L1   larval   stage,    SABs    have    several    NMJs    in    the
            anterior   ventral   cord   (b).   The   synaptic   input   onto   SABs   is   much   the   same    as    that    onto    VAn
            and   DAn   motoneurons;   it    comes    from    AVD    (a),    AVE    (a)    and    AVA    (a).    These    synapses    are
            often   clustered   together   (a),   making   synaptic   complexes   that   are   a   characteristic    feature    of    the
            neuropile of the retro-vesicular ganglion. SAB has gap junctions to AVA (c), DAn and VAn.

              SDQ   is   a   set   of   two   interneurons   with   laterally   located   cell   bodies.   The   cell   body   of    SDQL
            is   situated   in   the   anterior   body;   that   of   SDQR,   in   the   posterior   body.   Both   send   out    single,
            anteriorly  directed   processes,   which   initially   run   laterally   but   later   run   in   the   dorsal   sub-lateral
            cords,   and   then,   along    with    the    other    processes    from    these    cords,    enter    the    nerve    ring
            sub-dorsally.    The    processes    run    ventrally    round    the    inner    surface    of    the    ring    and     end
            sub-ventrally   on   the   contralateral   side.   Most   of    the    synapses    are    situated    mid-ventrally,    where
            the   processes    enlarge    somewhat.    There    is    significantly    more    synaptic    output    from    SDQR    than
            SDQL   and   this   may   reflect   the   fact   that   the   process   of   SDQR   is   shorter   than   that    of    SDQL.
            The   main   synaptic   outputs   are   to   AVB   (a),   AVA   (b,   c),   DVA   (a),   AIB   (c)   and   RIS   (c).   There
            are gap junctions to itself (d), AVB and RIV (d).

               SIA   is   a   set   of   four   interneurons,   which   send   processes   posteriorly   down   the   sub-lateral   cords.
             All  four   cell   bodies   are   in   the   ventral   ganglion.   The   SIAD   pair   sends   processes   that   enter   and
             run  round  the  nerve  ring,  leaving   it   on   the   contralateral   side   along   with   the   four   other   processes
             that   make   up   the   sub-lateral   cords   (e).   The   SIAV   pair   sends    processes    into    the    ring,    which
             loop   back   on   the   ipsilateral    side,    reentering    the    neuropile    of    the    ventral    ganglion'    these
             processes   then   leave   the   ventral   cord   at    the    amphidial    commissures    and    enter    the    sub-lateral
             cords  along  with  four  other  processes   (f).   SIA   is   unusual   in   that   it   appears   to   have   no   synaptic
             outputs   except,   perhaps,   via   gap   junctions   to    RIB    (a).    Synaptic    input    is    sparse    and    comes
             mainly   from   CEP   (b)   and   RIA   (c).   SIA   is   similar   in   some   respects   to   SIB;   the   two   sets    of
             processes run together in the nerve ring near the centre of the neuropile (d).

            sub-lateral    cords    via    the    amphidial    commissures    along    with    four    other    processes.    The    SIBD
            pair  have  cell   bodies   situated   in   the   lateral   ganglia.   ;They   send   processes   into   the   ventral   cord
            via   the   amphidial   commissures   and   then   run   round   lthe   nerve    ring,    leaving    it    sub-dorsally    on
            the   contralateral   side   along   with   the   four   other   processes   that   make   up    the    dorsal    sub-lateral
            cords   (e).   No   presynaptic   contacts   have   been   seen   on   these   cells   except    for    occasional    regions
            that   show   typical    presynaptic    specializations    but    have    no    vesicles    (a).    In    one    place    the
            process  of  an  SIBD  cell   was   seen   in   the   motor   endplate   region   of   the   nerve   ring   (b)   but   again
            no   vesicles   were   seen.   SIB   has   synaptic   input   from   OLQ.   (*b)   and   has    gap    junctions    to    RIB
            (c),   itself   (SIBD   to   SIBV),   AVB   (d)   (SIBV   only)   and   AIM   (*d)    (SIBD    only).    SIB    is    similar
            in  some  respects  to  S  IA  and  their  two  sets   of   processes   run   together   in   the   nerve   ring   near   the
            centre of the neuropile (SIA-d).

          Members' SMBDL, SMBDR, SMBVL, SMBVR.
            SMB  is  a   set   of   four   motoneurons,   which   innervate   muscles   in   the   head   via   NMJs   in   the   nerve
          ring   and   also   send   processes   posteriorly   down   the   sub-lateral   cords.   The   cell   bodies    of    S    MB
          are   situated   in   the   ventral   ganglion   and   send   anteriorly   directed   processes   into   the    nerve    ring
          (h,   i)   which   initially   run   near   the   centre   of   the   ring   neuropile.   When   the   processes   of    SMBV
          reach   a   sub-dorsal   position   they   loop   round   and   run   back   on   the   inside   surface   of    the    ring,
          where they have NMJs before reentering the neuropile of the ventral ganglion. They then leave

            312                                                       SMB

            the   ventral   cord   via   the   amphidial   commissures   and   take    up    their    positions,    along    with    four
            other   processes,   in   the   ventral   sub-lateral   cords.   The   SMBD   pair   run   round   to    the    contralateral
            side  of  the  nerve  ring   and   there   move   down   to   the   inside   surface   of   the   ring,   where   they   have
            their   NMJs.   They   leave   the   ring   sub-dorsally   and   enter   the   dorsal   sub-lateral    cords    along    with
            four   other   processes.   The   processes   of   S   MB   form   striking   structures   in   the    neuropile    of    the
            ventral   ganglion,   where   they   enlarge,   flatten   and   wrap    round    each    other    (c).    Another    striking
            feature   in   the   same    region    is    formed    by    the    synapses    of    SMBD    onto    SAAD;    vesicle-filled
            processes   from   SMBD   poke   into   the   cell   bodies   of    SAAD,    where    they    synapse    onto    them    (d).
            The   NMJs   of   SMB   are   situated   sub-ventrally    and    sub-dorsally    and    are    intercepted    by    dendrites
            from   RME    (e).    There    are    marked    differences    in    the    synaptic    contacts    made    by    SMBD    and
            SMBV.   Both   have   NMJs   (b,   e),   receive   their   main   synaptic   input   from   AIZ    (f),    and    a    little
            from   AVH   (*b)    and    DVA,    and    have    gap    junctions    to    AVK    (*e).    In    addition,    SMBD    alone

             SMD   is   a   set   of   four   motoneurons,   which   innervate   muscles   in    the    head    via    NMJs    in    the
           nerve   ring   and   also   send   processes   posteriorly   down   the   sub-lateral   cords.    The    cell    bodies    of
           SMDV   are   situated   sub-dorsally,   close   to   the   neuropile   of   the   nerve    ring    (j).    Processes    enter
           the  ring   sub-dorsally   from   the   cell   bodies   and   move   over   to   the   contralateral   side,   running   near
           the centre of the neuropile; they then enter the ventral cord. They leave the cord via the

            318                                                       SMD

            amphidial   commissures   and   take    up    their    sub-ventral    positions    along    with    the    other    processes
            of   the   sub-cords.   The   cell   bodies   of   SMDD    are    situated    in    the    ventral    ganglion    and    send
            anteriorly   directed   processes   into   the   nerve   ring   (i).   These   processes   run   round   the    ring,    near
            the  centre  of   the   neuropile,   and   leave   at   contralateral   sub-dorsal   positions   to   enter   the   sub-cords
            along   with   the   other   processes   of   the   dorsal   sub-cords.   The   dorsal   processes   of    SMDV    and    the
            ventral   processes   of   SMDD   are   large   and   have    an    irregular    shape,    often    wrapping    around    the
            processes   of   SAA   (c,   d),   with   which   they   are   closely   associated.   The   NMJs   of   SMD   are   situated
            near   the   ventral   (SMDV)   and   dorsal    (SMDD)    mid-lines    at    the    anterior    regions    of    the    inner
            surface   of   the   nerve   ring   and,   together   with   RME    NMJs,    form    distinctive    structures    in    these
            regions  (e,   f   and   figure   14).   SMD   neurons   send   unusual   small   processes   into   the   regions   of   the
            NMJs    of    their    dorso-ventral     symmetric     partners     (e-h),     which     have     terminal     electron-dense
            regions   that   look   similar   to   presynaptic   specializations.   No   synaptic   vesicles   are    seen    in    these
            regions,   however,   so   it   seems   unlikely    that    these    processes    are    presynaptic.    Their    disposition
            suggests   that   they   could   be   dendrites   receiving   synaptic    input    from    RME    and    the    symmetrically
            opposite   members   of   their   own   class.   The   main   synaptic    outputs    of    SMD    are    to    muscles    (e,
            f,   g,   h)   and   RIA   (a).   The   main   synaptic   inputs   are   from   RIA   (b),   OLL   (g,    h),    URY    (*a),
            RIM   (*e)   and   RIC   (*b);   there   is   probably   also   some   synaptic    input    from    RIV    (*d)    and    RME
            (*d). There are gap junctions to RMD, RIS, RIB, RIV (SMDV only) and itself.

             directed  processes  emanate  from  the  cell   bodies   and   run   in   four   of   the   six   labial   process   bundles.

             of   the   pharynx   and   the   buccal   cavity.   Posteriorly   directed   processes   from   the   cell   bodies    rejoin
             the   process   bundles   and   run   along   the   outside   of   the   ring.   The    bundles    then    turn    and    run
             anteriorly,  near  the  inside   surface   of   the   ring,   until   the   fibres   disperse   in   the   anterior   regions
             of   the   ring.   Processes   from   URA   run   along   the   inner   surface   and   anterior   regions   of   the    ring
             neuropile   and   terminate   laterallyl   URA   forms   distinctive    NMJs    in    the    anterior    regions    of    the
             ring   and,    together    with    RIP,    IL1    and    RMD,    makes    up    characteristic    synaptic    complexes    in
             these  regions  (a,  b).  NMJs  are  nearly  always   adjacent   to   the   process   of   an   RIP   cell   (a,   b).   This
             represents  the   sole   synaptic   output   except   for   a   few   possible   synapses   to   RME   at   an   NMJ   region
             (c). The main synaptic input is from IL2 (d) and CEP.

              URB is a set of two interneurons with cell  bodies  situated  laterally,  anteriorly  to  the  nerve
            ring. Processes directed anteriorly from the cell bodies  run  up  in  the  lateral  process  bundles.
            These processes peter out, with no terminal specializations,  at  about  the  level  of  the  junction
            of the buccal cavity and  the  pharynx.  The  posterior  branches  from  the  cell  bodies  run  along
            the outside of the nerve ring and then  turn  and  run  anteriorly  and  ventrally-,  near  the  inner
            surface of  the  nerve  ring,  eventually  ending  sub-ventrally.  URB  processes  partly  wrap  round
            those of SMB (c) sub-dorsally in  a  characteristic  manner.  The  main  synaptic  output  is  to  URX
            (a), CEP (b), RIC (d)  and  IL1;  there  is  some  reciprocal  synaptic  input  from  CEP.  There  are
            gap junctions to OLQ (*e) at the distal ends of the processes in the ring.

               URX   is   a   set   of    two    neurons    with    cell    bodies    that    are    situated    sub-dorsally    in    the
             pseudocoelomic   cavity    just    posterior    to    the    ring    neuropile.    Processes    project    anteriorly    from
             the   cell   bodies   into   the   sub-dorsal   labial   process   bundles    and    have    specialized,    flattened    but
             non-ciliated   endings   associated   with   the   dorsal   inner   labial    sensilla    (figure.    I).    A    posteriorly
             directed  process   from   the   cell   bodies   loops   round   the   ring,   enters   it   sub-dorsally   and   then   runs
             ventrally   round   the   ring   near   the   outside    surface,    ending    sub-ventrally.    Short    branches    project
             laterally   into   the   regions   of   neuropile   near   the   inner   surface    (b).    The    main    synaptic    output
             is   to   RIA   and   AUA   (a)   via   exclusively   dyadic   synapses,   to   AVE   on    the    lateral    branches    (b,
             c),   to   RIG   (d),   AVB   and   RIC.   The   main   synaptic   input   is   from   URB   (c)   and   RIR   (*a).    There
             are gap junctions to AUA, RMG and IL2.

              URY  is   a   set   of   four   neurons   with   cell   bodies   situated   anterior   to   the   nerve   ring.   Processes
            project   anteriorly   from   the   cell   bodies   into   the   two   sub-dorsal   and   the    two    sub-ventral    labial
            process   bundles.   These   processes   enlarge   and   flatten   at   their   endings    (which    are    not    ciliated),
            at   which   point   they   are   closely   apposed   to   the   inner   labial   and   the   outer   labial   sheath   cells
            (figure   1).   A   posteriorly   directed   branch   from   the   sub-dorsal   cell   bodies   forms   a    complete    loop
            round  the  underside  of  the  ring  and  then  across  to  a   point   where   it   meets   up   with   itself;   it   then
            runs   dorsally   round   the   ring   near   the   outside   surface.   The   sub-ventral   cells   are    similar    except
            that  they  do  not   loop   round   the   ring   but   briefly   enter   the   middle   of   the   ring   neuropile   before
            returning   to   the   outside   regions   of    the    neuropile    and    running    ventrally.    When    the    processes
            of  the  URY  neurons   run   round   the   ring,   they   are   in   close   association   with   the   processes   of   RIB
            (b).   The   main   synaptic   output   is   to   SMD    via    large    monadic    synapses    (a),    RMD,    usually    in
            association   with   AVE   at   dyadic   synapses   (b,   c)   and   possibly   also   RIB.   There   are    gap    junctions
            to RIG (d) and AVA.

              VAn  is  a  set  of  twelve  motoneurons,  distributed  along  the  ventral  cord,  which   innervate
            ventral body muscles.  A  typical  VAn  neuron  (e.g.  VA3  (f))  has  a  short,  posteriorly  directed
            process that runs in the ventral part of the  process  bundle.  This  process  is  always  postsynaptic
            and  receives  synaptic  input  from  AVA  (*c)  and  AVD  (*a);  in  addition,  VA1  to  VA3   receive
            synaptic input from  AVE  (*c).  There  are  also  gap  junctions  to  AVA  (b),  ASn  (*d)  and  other
            VAn neurons, but these may be  situated  on  the  anterior  as  well  as  the  posterior  processes.  A
            long, anteriorly directed process leaves the cell  body  and  moves  to  a  position  adjacent  to  the
            bounding basal lamina on the  right-hand  side  of  the  cord,  in  between  an  adjacent  ventral  VBn
            process and a dorsal VDn  process  (figure  18).  VAn  processes  have  NMJs  when  they  are  in  this
            position; the NMJs are  nearly  all  dyadic  synapses  with  DDn  neurons  as  the  other  postsynaptic
            partner (a).  The  anterior  process  of  a  VAn  eventually  moves  away  from  the  NMJ  region,  its
            place being taken by the process of the adjacent anterior VAn. The anterior distal regions of

                           VAn                                                                                                                                              329

            the   VAn   processes   then   run   for   some   distance   in   the   ventral   region   of   the   cord   before    ending
            with  little  or  no  synaptic   contacts   with   other   cells.   The   VAn   neurons   at   either   end   of   the   cord
            (i.e.   VA1   and   VAI2)   are   somewhat    different    from    the    rest.    VA1    (e),    in    common    with    VB1
            and   VD1   which   are   all   in   the    region    immediately    posterior    to    the    excretory    duct,    branches
            and   has   its   NMJs   arranged   transversely   along   a    confined    region    along    the    dorsal    surface    of
            the   nerve   cord.    VAI2    (g)    has    a    similar    morphology    to    VA2-VAll    but    has    some    additional
            types   of   synaptic   contact.   It   receives   synaptic   input    from    PHC,    PHB,    AVA    and    possibly    VDI2
            and   VDI3.   It   has   dyadic   NMJs   with   VDI2,   VDI3    and    DD6    as    the    other    postsynaptic    partners.
            In  addition  VA12  also   synapses   onto   DA8   (c),   DA9   (c),   DB7   (c),   AS   11,   and   PVC   (d)   in   various
            combinations at multiple synapses. There are gap junctions to AVA, PHC and VB11.

               VBn  is  a  set  of  eleven  motoneurons,  distributed  along  the  ventral  cord,  which  innervate
             ventral body muscles. A  typical  VBn  (e.g.  VB4  (h))  has  a  short,  anteriorly  directed  process
             that runs in the ventral  part  of  the  cord.  This  process  is  always  postsynaptic  and  receives
             synaptic  input  from  PVC  (except  in  VB1  and  VB2)  and  occasionally   DVA   (*d).   There   are
             prominent gap junctions to AVB, which  are  usually  (although  not  exclusively  (c))  situated  near
             the cell body. VBn also has gap junctions with other VBns (d) and DBns; these can be situated

           anywhere   along   the   processes.   A   long,    posteriorly    directed    process    leaves    the    cell    body    and
           moves   to   a   position   adjacent   to   the   bounding   basal   lamina   on   the   right-hand   side   of   the   cord,
           next   to   a   dorsal   VAn   process   (figure   18).   VBn   processes   have    NMJs    when    they    are    in    this
           position;    the    NMJs    are    nearly    always    dyadic    synapses    with    DDn     neurons     as     the     other
           postsynaptic   partner   (a).   The    posterior    process    of    VBn    eventually    moves    away    from    the    NMJ
           region,  its   place   being   taken   by   the   process   of   the   adjacent   posterior   VBn.   The   posterior   distal
           regions   of   the   VBn   processes   then   run   for   some   considerable   distance   in   the   ventral    region    of
           the  cord,  with  little  or   no   synaptic   contact   with   other   cells,   before   terminating.   VB1   (e,   f)   and
           VB2   (g)   differ   in   their   morphology   and   in   synaptic   contacts   from    the    other    VBns.    Both    have
           branches  that  run  transversely  across  the   dorsal   surface   of   the   cord   just   posterior   of   the   excretory
           duct,  although  only   VB1   has   NMJs   in   this   region.   VB1   also   has   a   process   that   enters   the   left-
           hand   side   of   the   nerve   ring,   which   synapses   onto   SAA    (b)    and    receives    some    synaptic    input
           from AIB.

                VCn   is   a   set   of   six   motoneurons   in   the   ventral   cord,   which   innervate    ventral    body    muscles
              and   the   vm2   muscles   of   the   vulva.   VC4   and   VC5   (h),   which   are    situated    nearest    the    vulva,
              have   short   processes   in   the   ventral   cord   but   send   several   processes   dorsally    along    the    vulval
              hyperdermis    on    each    side    of    the    vulval    opening,    where    they     have     large,     vesicle-filled
              varicosities   and   innervate   vm2   vulval   muscles    (a).    They    also    synapse    onto    other    VC    neurons
              and receive some synaptic input from HSN in these regions. VC1, VC2, VC3 and VC6 send

            less  extensive   processes,   which   have   similar   synaptic   contacts,   into   these   vulval   regions,   but   they
            have   much   longer   processes   in   the   ventral   cord   (h).   These   processes   run   near    or    adjacent    to
            the  bounding  basal  lamina   in   the   dorsal   region   of   the   cord   (figure   18).   There   they   synapse   onto
            DDn   and   VDn   neurons   (c)   and   have   NMJs   that   are   dyadic,   with   DDn    and    VDn    as    the    second
            postsynaptic   element   (b).   VCn   neurons   have   gap   junctions   with    each    other    (e)    and    also    have
            some   chemical   synapses   with   each   other.   There   are   some   features   that   seem    to    be    unique    for
            particular   VCns   that   may   be   significant:   VC5   synapses    onto    DVB    and    DVC    (d)    and    VC3    has
            a gap junction directly to the process from a vm2 muscle (f).

           Members: VD 1 to VD 13.
             VDn   is   a   set   of   thirteen   motoneurons,   with   cell   bodies   in   the   ventral   cord,    which    innervate
           ventral   muscles.   Each   cell   has   an   anteriorly   directed   process   emanating   from   its   cell   body.    This
           process  has  a   branch,   which   leaves   the   ventral   cord   on   the   right   as   a   commissure   (c)   and   runs
           round   to   the   dorsal   cord.   (VD2   is   exceptional;   it   has   a    left-hand    commissure.)    The    commissure
           splits,  as  it  enters   the   dorsal   cord,   into   an   anteriorly   and   a   posteriorly   directed   process,   which
           span   approximately   the   same   region   of   the    body    as    their    ventral    counterparts    (e).    (VD1    is
           exceptional  in  that  its  dorsal   process   is   anterior   to   its   ventral   counterpart.)   Both   the   dorsal   and
           the   ventral   processes   run   adjacent   to   the   basal   lamina   bounding   the   cord,    in    close    association
           with   the   processes   of   DDn   neurons.    The    ventral    process    lies    between    the    processes    of    VCn
           dorsally    and    the    other    motoneuron    classes    ventraily    (figure    18).    The    dorsal    process     runs
           ventrally   to   the   other   motoneuron   axons   (figure    19)<    The    VDn    processes    in    the    dorsal    cord
           are   exclusively   postsynaptic,   receiving   synaptic   input    from    DAn    (*a),    DBn    (*a)    and    ASn    (*a)
           motoneurons    at    points    where    they    have    NMJs.    The    processes     in     the     ventral     cord     are
           predominantly   presynaptic   and   have    many    NMJs    (a,    b),    most    of    which    have    only    muscle    as
           the   postsynaptic    partner.    The    processes    of    VDn    and    DDn    do    not    have    extended,    apparently
           undifferentiated   distal   regions,   as   do   the   other    motoneuron    classes;    instead,    they    end    abruptly
           in   close   proximity   to   the   end   of   a   neighbouring   process   of   the   same   class,   often   with   a   gap
           junction between them (d). VDn also has gap junctions to DDn and a few with PVP. VD1
           has several additional 'odd' gap junctions.

                           APPENDIX            2.             REMAINING             AMBIGUITIES

              The   reconstructions    that    we    have    described    were    done    piecemeal,    using    data    obtained    from
            several   animals.   This   was   because   of   the   difficulty   of   serial    sectioning    a    complete    individual.
            Inevitably   there   were   some    consequential    problems    in    the    identification    of    equivalent    processes
            in   different   animals.   These   problems   could,   for   the    most    part,    be    resolved,    because    of    the
            reproducibility    of    relative    process     positions     within     bundles     and     the     consistent     synaptic
            behaviour    of    a    given    process.    There    are,    however,    a    few     remaining     ambiguities,     notably
            concerning   process   identification   in   the   posterior   ventral   cord.   This   region    was    covered    by    the
            N2Y   series,   which   was   derived   from   an   adult   male.    The    male    has    significantly    more    processes
            running    in    its    ventral    cord    than    the    hermaphrodite.     These     extra     processes     arise     from
            male-specific   neurons   in   the   tail   ganglia   (Sulston   et   al.   1980).   Their   presence   made   it   difficult
            to   identify   some   of   the   processes   from   neurons   common   to    both    sexes,    particularly    those    that
            were rather featureless, with few characteristic synapses. We have listed the cases for which
            these problems exist.
                                   DVB       AND        DVC

              The   processes    from    these    two    neurons    are    always    closely    associated.    They    sometimes    twist
            round   each    other    and    so    cannot    be    distinguished    by    their    relative    positions.    We    cannot,
            therefore,   be   sure   whether   the   cell    bodies    labelled    DVB    and    DVC    connect    to    the    processes
            labelled   DVB   and   DVC   in   the   nerve   ring   or   whether    they    have    been    crossed    over.    We    have
            chosen the interpretation that is shown on the basis of synaptic criteria, but these are not
            particularly compelling.
                                 ALA,     CAN      AND      PVD

              These   neuron   classes   have   processes   that   run   together   alongside   the   two    lateral    arms    of    the
            excretory   canal.   They   have   not   been   followed   along    the    length    of    the    animal,    although    they
            have   been   sampled    at    intervals    along    their    length.    The    three    processes    make    virtually    no
            synaptic   connections   along   the   canal   and   look   rather   similar.   Two   of   the   processes   end   at   about
            the  level  of  the  anus;  the   third   enters   the   lumbar   ganglion   on   each   side,   where   it   makes   a   few
            synapses   Onto   PVC.   This   process   has   been   tentatively    assigned    to    ALA,    but    it    could    equally
            well belong to either of the other classes.

                                 PVW,      PQR      AND      PVT

               These   classes   have   cell   bodies   in   the   lumbar   ganglia    and    the    pre-anal    ganglion;    they    send
             out   processes,   which   project   anteriorly   up   the   ventral   cord.    Processes    from    these    neurons    have
             not  been  positively  identified  in   the   N2Y   series   and   are   not   present   in   the   anterior   ventral   cord
             (i.e.   they   could   not   be   accounted   for   in   the   N2U   series).   It   therefore   seems   likely   that   they
             terminate    somewhere    in    the    posterior    ventral    cord.    The    process    of    PQR    appeared     to     be
             petering   out   at   the   end   of   the   JSE   series   and   was   almost   certainly   about   to   end.    The    same
             cannot  be  said  of   PVT,   however.   The   single   neuron   of   this   class   had   a   large   cell   body   in   the
             pre-anal   ganglion   with   a   single,   substantial,   anteriorly    directed    process.    This    process    had    few
             synaptic  contacts  and   was   still   going   at   the   anterior   extent   of   the   JSE   series.   It   seems   rather
             surprising   that   such   a   process    should    end,    presumably    without    making    any    significant    synaptic
             contacts.   An   alternative   interpretation   is   that   this    process    divides    somewhere    in    the    posterior
             cord   and   becomes   the   two   processes   currently    assigned    to    PVNL/R    in    the    anterior    cord.    The
             location  of  the  process  of   PVT   in   the   cord   is   consistent   with   this   interpretation.   It   would   mean,
             however, that in this case PVNL/R would have to terminate in the posterior cord.

            340                                        APPENDIX 3.

                                 RID,    PDA    AND     PDB

              These  three  classes  have  processes  in  the  dorsal  cord,  which  have  not   been   completely
            followed. RID sends a process into the anterior  end  of  the  cord;  a  process  that  looks  similar
            has been identified in the posterior dorsal cord. It therefore seems likely that  the  dorsal  process
            of RID spans the length of the  cord.  The  process  of  PDA  and  PDB  enter  the  dorsal  cord  near
            its posterior extremity. They project  anteriorly  but  have  not  been  identified  in  the  anterior
            cord.
