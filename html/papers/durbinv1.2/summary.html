   The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is a small invertebrate whose 
   nervous system, general anatomy, and normal development are all 
   (comparatively) extremely simple and reproducible, and have all been well 
   characterised.  This dissertation describes work based on two different 
   approaches to the study of the control of neural development in <BR>
   <i>C. elegans</i>.

   In the first part the course of neural outgrowth in the region of the 
   ventral nerve cord was followed from electron microscope reconstructions of 
   a series of fixed embryos.  Following this, neurons whose processes grew 
   out early were removed by laser ablation of their parent cells and the 
   effect on subsequent nerve outgrowth was assayed by electron microscope 
   reconstruction.  The first process to grow along the ventral cord is that 
   of AVG, and its presence is required for the normal, highly asymmetrical 
   structure of the cord.  Two more examples of dependancy on particular nerve 
   processes for correct guidance can be deduced from experiments in which 
   cells at the back of the animal were removed.  The observations of normal 
   development and the ablation experiments can in some cases be related to 
   defects seen in <i>uncoordinated</i> mutants with defective nerve process 
   organisation.

   The second approach was to establish and analyse a computer data base 
   containing all the synaptic connectivity data obtained by White <I>et al.</I>
   (1986), who reconstructed at an electron microscope level the entire 
   central nervous system regions of two <i>C. elegans</i>
   specimens.  Since the circuitry is highly reproducible, comparisons of 
   connections between equivalent pairs of cells can be used to infer 
   properties of synapse formation.  Overall, the <i>C. elegans</i> circuitry 
   is anatomically highly directional, and what little chemical synaptic 
   feedback that is seen is mostly part of reciprocal synaptic connections.  
   There is also evidence for physical organisation of the nerve processes in 
   subbundles of the main process tract in the central nervous system.
