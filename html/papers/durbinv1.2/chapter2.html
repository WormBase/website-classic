   <p class=boxed><i>C. elegans</i> (var. Bristol, N2 strain) was propogated on lawns of E. Coli grown on agar
   Petri plates, as described by Brenner (1974).</p>

2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>C. elegans</i> neuronal nomenclature</H3>
   <p class=boxed>The 302 neurons are divided into 118 classes on the basis of
   morphology and synaptic connectivity.  Each neuron's name consists
   of two or three capital letters denoting the class and a suffix
   denoting which member of that class it is.  The motor neurons in
   the nerve cord have two letter roots and a number as a suffix, so
   <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DA2;class=Cell">DA2</a> is the second member of the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> class (counting from the front). 
   Interneurons have three letter roots and use the suffix letters L,
   R, D, and V to distinguish left, right, dorsal, and ventral
   members.  Thus <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> is the left member of the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> class.  Unique
   neurons, such as <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, have no suffix.  When referring to a class
   rather than one of its members merely the two or three letter route name is used.</p>

2.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Electron microscopy</H3>
   <p class=boxed>Embryos were isolated by dissolving gravid adults with 1%
   hypochlorite, 0.5 M KOH for 5 mins, collecting the eggs through a
   52 micron filter (Nitex) then rinsing the eggs three times in M9
   buffer.  The eggshells were digested with chitinase following the
   the procedure of Wolf <i>et al.</i>  (1983), and the remaining viteline
   membrane was broken mechanically by pipetting the chitinased eggs
   through a drawn pasteur pipette.  After removal of the eggshell the
   embryos were fixed in 1% OsO<SUB>4</SUB>, 0.8% KFe(CN)<SUB>6</SUB> (0.1M
   cacodylate buffer, pH 6.0) for 45 minutes at room temperature. 
   They were then rinsed in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, and
   treated for 15 mins with 0.2% tannic acid (Malinckrodt) in the
   same buffer.  Finally they were rinsed in dH<SUB>2</SUB>O and straight embyos
   of approximately the right age were embedded, sectioned, and
   stained as in White <i>et al.</i>  (1986).  Adults were simply fixed for
   one hour in 1% OsO<SUB>4</SUB> in 0.1 M NaPO<SUB>4</SUB>, pH 7.4, and cut in
   half before embedding to ensure proper infiltration.  The sections
   were viewed on an AEI 6B electron microscope and photographs were
   taken every 2 to 3 sections (nominal section thickness, 50nm) at a
   magnification of 3 to 10 thousand.  I am very grateful to J N
   Thomson, who did all the serial sectioning with uncanny consistency
   and reliability.  J. Priess developed the fixation protocol used
   here.</p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.3">
2.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ablations</H3>
   <p class=boxed>In order to remove specific cells from the developing nervous
   system the parent of the desired cell was ablated using a laser
   microbeam.  To obtain embryos, gravid adults were cut open in a
   watch glass of distilled water (dH<SUB>2</SUB>O).  About 30 embryos of
   approximately the right age were transferred to a 3% agar pad and
   grouped together.  The surrounding agar was cut away to leave a 3mm
   x 10mm strip, and a cover slip was placed on top, held in place
   with dabs of hot vaseline on the corners.  Extra water was added to
   prevent dessication.  Under the slight pressure of the cover slip
   approximately half the embryos lie ventral side up, as desired, and
   the pattern of individual cell nuclei around the desired time can
   be reliably recognised using Nomarski optics (pattern shown in
   figure 2.1).

   A line drawing of the position of the cell nuclei on the ventral surface of 
   the embryo at 270 mins, the approximate time when the laser ablations were 
   performed.  Anterior is at the top of the page.  Nuclei are clearly visible 
   by Nomarski microscopy.  Most neural precursor cells at this stage will 
   divide one more time.  Cells that were ablated are shaded and their normal 
   daughters are shown.  An X represents a cell that dies soon after birth.  
   The smaller crosshatched cells are cells that die around the time of this 
   picture; they are very distinctive and provide useful landmarks.  (Adapted 
   from Sulston <I>et al.</I>, 1983).

   Ablations were executed with a pulsed laer (PRA LA1000/LN102 used with 
   Courmarin 450 dye), whose beam is focussed down the microscope objective as 
   in Sulston and white (1980).  The chosen cell was killed with repeated low 
   energy laser pulses (20-100 hits).  After 15-20 mins the dead cell shrinks 
   into a condensed refractile ball.  If it is on the ventral surface, as with 
   all but one (<a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a>) 
   of this set of experiments, then it is excluded from the embryo when the 
   hypodermis, which starts as a patch on the dorsal side, closes over about 
   45 mins after the ablation (figure 2.2).

   <p class=fig>
   <B>Figure 2.2</B><br>
   After ventral surface cells are killed the remains are excluded from the 
   embryo when the ventral hypodermis seals up at around 320 mins.  Here the 
   ablated parent of PVPL is shown at approximately 350 mins (arrowed).  The 
   total length of the egg is 60 microns.

   After monitoring exclusion of the dead cell
   in the experimental embryos, they were transferred either to petri
   dishes with bacteria if they were to hatch, or, if they were to be
   fixed as older embryos, to a8 well multi test well slides (Flow
   Labs) subbed with 0.1% polylysine.  The fixation protocolw as
   above, all the fixation steps being carried out with the embryos
   inside their eggshells attached to the test well slides.  In order
   to allow access of fixatives etc.  to the embryos, the laser wa
   sued to make a small hole in the eggshell in the presence of the
   first (OsO<SUB>4</SUB>) fixative at the chosen stage of development.  Fixed
   embryos were dislodged from their slides and embdeed and sectioned
   as above.</p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.4">
2.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconstruction</H3>
   <p class=boxed>Prints were made from each negative and the reconstruction
   was carried out directly from the prints by writing a label inside
   each profile with a drafting pen and following the labels from one
   photograph to the next.  In many cases nerve cells and processes
   were immediately identifiable, but when this was not so an
   arbitrary label was used and the cell was identified later if
   possible.  The criteria used for neuron identification are given
   below.  Aside from the problem of identification of a correctly
   reconstructed cell there may be problems in forming a continuous
   reconstruction itself.  Usually these problems are generated either
   by a number of consecutive sections being unphotographable because
   of grid bars or dirt on the grid covering the sections, or by the
   neuropil being cut tangentially to some nerve processes so that the
   membrane boundaries become indistinct.  In all the cases considered
   here these problems were satisfactorily resolved, when necessary by
   checking internal consistency (e.g. a process with two attached
   cell bodies is no good, nor is an unattached process) or
   consistency with the equivalent cells in other reconstructions. 
   One embryonic <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> ablation reconstruction was abandoned because
   processes could not be definitely linked across a break.  Generally
   these difficulties are less severe in embryonic than in adult
   reconstructions, since there are many fewer processes in each
   bundle and the processes have smoother trajectories; they are not
   so tightly constrained by other tissues, particularly since the
   muscle is till not fully developed.<br><br>Altogether 19
   reconstructions of varying regions of different embryos were
   undertaken, using around 3000 photographs.</p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.5">
2.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Staging of reconstructed embryos</H3>
   <p class=boxed>None of the reconstructions described in this dissertation
   came from timed embryos.  Stages were assigned by placing them in a
   developmental sequence and comparing them with short serial
   reconstructions from less ideal embryos of known age at fixation,
   and with previously known developmental events that were detectable
   in the reconstructions (e.g. cell divisions and movements).  The
   timed embryos were obtained by cutting open gravid adults and
   selecting embryos at the two cell stage.  These were incubated at
   25 C and then fixed by the same method as the ablation experimental
   embryos (above).  Development times at 25 C were converted to times
   at 20 C from standard growth curves (Schierenberg, 1978).</p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.6">
2.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of neurons</H3>
    <p class=boxed>There are several factors that make cell and process
    identification from electron microscope reconstructions relatively
    straightforward in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos.  To begin with, there is
    simply not very much there.  Figure 3.7 show typical ventral cord
    and preanal ganglion sections.  What cells there are are
    sufficiently different from one another to be easily and
    reproducibly distinguishable.  The positions and identities of all
    the cell bodies are known throughout embryonic development from
    the remarkable work of Sulston <i>et al.</i>  (1983) obtained by light
    microscopy with Nomarski optics.  All the cells under
    consideration here have an invariant lineage, and their relative
    cell body positions are extremely reproducible.  Second, the nerve
    process morphologies are simple enough to be fully traceable in
    the reconstructions.  They are also highly reproducible and all
    their adult forms are known from the equally enclylopaedic work of
    white <i>et al.</i>  (1986).  Figure 1.3 shows the approximate positions
    of all the neurons behind the RVG (see also Sulston <i>et al.</i>  1983
    for camera lucida drawings at different stages).  In general all
    cell bodies and processes were identified in all reconstructions. 
    I give below the specific criteria used to identify the various
    cells, followed by a discussion of the remaining cases where
    complete identification was not possible.</p>
    
       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc2.6.1">
2.6.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;AVG</H4>
    <p class=boxed>The ventral cord process was followed back to a cell body in the
    RVG in the A and B wild type reconstructions.  <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> is the
    only neuron in the RVG to send a process back along the whole
    length of the ventral cord, and the position of the cell body was
    as expected in each case.  In other reconstructions <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> was
    identified by the fact that it was the only continuous process in
    the ventral cord (if the series was early enough) or because it is
    the only process to grow into the DRG (<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVA;class=Cell">DVA</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a>
    have cell bodies in the DRG and grow down out of it).  Ablation of
    <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AB.prpapppa;class=Cell">AB.prpapppa</a>, the parent of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, removed the ventral

       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc2.6.2">
2.6.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ventral cord motor neurons:</H4>
    <p class=boxed>These were identifiable by
    cell body order and the direction of outgrowth of processes and
    commissures, which were known to be invariant from larval and
    adult reconstructions.  In all cases unique identifications could
    be made which were entirely compatible to the known data (except
    in the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> parent ablations commissure direction was altered
    though the order of cell classes remained as normal).  In the
    early series, before commissures grow out, the cell bodies overlap
    and there is a vertical order, with <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> cells overlapping dorsally
    to <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> cells, which in turn are dorsal to <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cells (consistent with
    Normarski observations of Sulston <i>et al.</i>, 1983).</p>

2.6.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;PAG cells:</H4>
    <p class=boxed>The relative positions of PAG cell bodies are shown in
    figure 1.3.  The only variability that was found in
    reconstructions was that the body of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a> was sometimes more
    anterior, underneath <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVT;class=Cell">PVT</a>. The following diagnostic
    criteria confirmed assignments: <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVT;class=Cell">PVT</a> never sent out a process in
    any embryonic reconstruction and always was the most anterior
    ventral ectodermal cell to contact the rectal epithelium (repVL
    and repVR).  <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> have a unique process morphology in the
    PAG since their processes cross over when they leave their cell
    bodies, and then grow forward along opposite sides of the cord. 
    <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a> has a standard <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> type process; also the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> process and, to
    a lesser extent, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> processes tend to flatten out on the

    position of their cell bodies and lineage, in accordance with the
    general practice for <i>C. elegans</i> neuronal nomenclature and with
    Sulston <i>et al.</i>  (1983).  The ablations confirm that the cells do
    not exchange positions after being born.  Since their processes
    cross over this means that the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> process is on the left.  This
    is reversed from the nomenclature of White <i>et al.</i>  (1986), in
    which <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> has its process on the right.  The reason for this
    inconsistency is that the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> cells are squashed into a line in

2.6.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lateral cells:</H4>
    <p class=boxed>The few neurons with cell bodies lying on the lateral hypodermis
    (figure 1.3) are well spaced out and can easily be identified on
    the basis of cell position.</p>
    
       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc2.6.7">
2.6.7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;RVG Cells</H4>
    <p class=boxed>The <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RVG;class=Cell">RVG</a> was only reconstructed in the A and B wild type
    reconstructions.  AVG was identifiable by its posterior process. 
    The three bilateral sets of cells (<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFL;class=Cell">RIFL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFR;class=Cell">RIFR</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIGL;class=Cell">RIGL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIGR;class=Cell">RIGR</a>, 
    <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SABVL;class=Cell">SABVL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SABVR;class=Cell">SABVR</a>) could be paired
    off according to position, size and process growth.  Other cell
    identifications were made on the basis of position, and are not
    completely definite.  However the only cells that I discuss below
    are <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, and the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFL;class=Cell">RIFL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFR;class=Cell">RIFR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SABVL;class=Cell">SABVL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SABVR;class=Cell">SABVR</a> neurons and their identifications
    are certain.<br><br>The only cases apart from the lumbar commissure
    processes and the RVG in which definite identifications were not
    made are in the anterior D reconstruction.  Here the majority of
    interneurons cannot be individually identified.  On the left side
    of the cord only two processes are present at the posterior end of
    the reconstruction, so they must be <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a>, since they grow
    forward together from the back.  There is also one anterior
    process running part way back.  This could either be <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a> or <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RMEV;class=Cell">RMEV</a>.
    On the right side there are 4 processes present at the front of
    the reconstruction that terminate at some point before the back. 
    These are presumably interneurons with cell bodies around the
    ring, but to identify them individually would require
    reconstructing the entire nerve ring region.  There are also 7
    processes running through the entire reconstruction, which
    probably include <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> since the left hand versions of
    these have grown right through the reconstruction.  It is not
    possible to identify the others.</p>
