  <p class=boxed>
  The last two chapters have described the results of a number of electron 
  microscope reconstructions of the developing ventral nervous system in both 
  normal and experimental <i>C. elegans</i>  embryos. In a short space of 
  around an hour the first nerve process grows back along the ventral cord 
  from the front, the motor neurons in the ventral cord grow commissures 
  around the body of the animal to form the dorsal cord, and a number of 
  additional processes grow forward from the preanal ganglion at the back of 
  the animal.  The short time taken in laying down the skeleton of the 
  ventral nerve cord and preanal ganglion reflects the rapid development of 
  C. elegans embryos (13 hours total).  The small number of cells present, 
  and the simple morphologies of the nerve cells, allow precise suggestions 
  to be made about the roles of individual cells during process outgrowth.  
  Several possible intercellular interactions were investigated by killing 
  the parents of specific cells with a focussed laser beam.  Before 
  discussing the pattern of process outgrowth in the ventral nervous system, 
  and how it might be controlled, I will first consider the reliability of 
  the observations on which the work is based.
  </p>
  
  <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc5.1"> 5.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reliability</H3>
  
  <p class=boxed>
  The approach of reconstruction from serial electron micrographs precludes 
  the examination of a large number of individual animals, either in the wild 
  type time series or in any particular experiment.  It is reasonable to ask 
  whether reliable conclusions can be drawn from the necessarily small number 
  of reconstructed animals that have been presented: there are two possible 
  sources of error or variation: experimental "noise" created by variability 
  in the observational and experimental techniques, and natural variability 
  of the phenomena themselves. <br>
  <br>
  As far as the determination of process disposition is concerned the 
  technique is very reliable; each individual reconstruction provides a large 
  amount of information at a very fine level of detail, so that essentially 
  all the nerve processes present can be positively identified and a complete 
  picture of the relevant parts of each neuron determined (the exceptions are 
  discussed in Chapter 2).  The technique of laser ablation of individual 
  identified cells is also very specific.  It is unlikely that the killed 
  cell has any residual influence, because, except for the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
  parent ablation, when no subsequent change was seen in any other cells 
  anyway, the dead cell was observed to be excluded from the embryo when the 
  hypodermis closed up (figure 2.2).  It is in principle possible to damage 
  neighbouring cells at the time of ablation, and in fact one of the embryos 
  sectioned in the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD3;class=Cell">DD3</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD5;class=Cell">DD5</a> 
  set showed signs of general morphological disorganisation, presumably due 
  to such damage.  However in all the cases discussed, except the <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  experiments, any changes that were observed were confined to a small number 
  of neurons normally associated with the particular missing cell.  Although 
  control experiments in which random neighbouring cells were ablated were 
  not performed, altogether six different cells all near together on the 
  ventral surface of the 270 minute embryo (figure 2.1) were ablated without 
  there being any overlap in the observed consequences.  <br>
  <br>
  As regards intrinsic variation, all the reconstructions are consistent with 
  a fixed time sequence of normal axonal outgrowth.  When a change in this 
  pattern was seen in laser ablation experiments then, again excepting the <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  experiments, it was clean and restricted in its extent, was generally 
  observed in at least two cases, and was consistent, never being seen in one 
  case but not another.  The situation with respect to the removal of <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  appeared to show variability and is discussed more fully in the next 
  section.  However, taking all the results together and in conjunction with 
  the known fixed adult anatomy, there is sufficient evidence to indicate 
  that the developing <i>C. elegans</i>  nervous system is simple and 
  reproducible enough for the techniques used here to provide an accurate 
  picture of events.  <br>
  <br>
  The high level of reproducibility and the generally restricted, fixed 
  effect of removal of individual cells are typical of <i>C. elegans</i>  
  development and anatomy.  The cell lineage and the disposition of somatic 
  cells at all stages of development are known to be nearly invariant 
  (Sulston and Horvitz, 1979, Kimble and Hirsh, 1979, Sulston <i>et al.</i>, 
  1983) the final antomy is equally stereotyped (White <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  
  Although a number of cases of adjustment in cell lineage after individual 
  cell ablations are known (e.g. Sulston and White, 1980, Sulston et al., 
  1983) they are the exception rather than the rule, and in no case do they 
  result in complete regulation back to the native form.  All the results of 
  ablation experiments performed here are consistent with only the daughters 
  of the ablated cell being missing, and with there being no change of 
  identity of any other cell.  In addition they confirm the relevant cell 
  assignments in the embryonic lineage, since in each case only the expected 
  cell or cells was or were missing.

  <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc5.2"> 5.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The asymmetry of the ventral 
  cord</H3>
  
  <p class=boxed>
  One of the striking features of the <i>C. elegans</i>  ventral nervous 
  system is the almost, but not quite, complete asymmetry of the ventral 
  nervous cord, which has around 55 neurons on the right side and only 4 or 
  so on the left.  If all the processes were together on the right hand side 
  then it could be regarded as a single fused nerve that was displaced to one 
  side for steric reasons, but since a small number of left/right pairs of 
  processes are arranged symmetrically (<a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>/<a

  and in the adult, <a class=cell

  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=HSNR;class=Cell">HSNR</a>) 
  the question arises of why not all the others?  In fact the arrangement is 
  essentially symmetrical anterior to the RVG; the cord splits into two to 
  pass the excretory duct on both sides, with each bilateral pair of 
  processes being split so there is one member on each side, an stays 
  symmetrical throughout the ventral ganglion and into the bottom of the 
  nerve ring.  <br>
  <br>
  Most animals with a symmetrical body plan have a symmetrical ventral 
  nervous system, often consisting of a chain of ganglia linked by paired 
  nerves, which are sometimes fused but clearly retain their symmetrical 
  character.  There are in fact some nematodes that have symmetrical paired 
  ventral cords (Martini, 1916).  Chitwood and Chitwood (1974), in discussing 
  the differences amongst nematode species, state (p.  162): <br>
  <br>
  Differences in the central nervous system lie chiefly in the degree of 
  subdivision of the lateral ganglia, the form of the ventral ganglia, and 
  the degree of fusion of the ventral nerves.<br>
  <br>
  They go on to state that in many species both around the RVG and for some 
  distance anterior to the PAG there are symmetrical paired nerves, though in 
  most cases these are fused for the main part of the length of the body.  
  They continue (p.  163): <br>
  <br>
  The apparent doubleness in both anterior and posterior ends of the ventral 
  nerve caused Meissner and many later authors to conclude that the entire 
  nerve was at one time double. (we) subscribe to the primitive double 
  ventral nerve hypothesis.  <br>
  <br>
  Several observations that have been made in this study are relevant to the 
  origin of cord asymmetry. Perhaps I should start with <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>. 
  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  is a unique neuron with its body in the RVG, it is the first neuron to send 
  a process out along the ventral cord, and it sends it along the right hand 
  side. When <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  was removed by ablating its parent the cord was seen to be disrupted in two 
  ways.  <br>
  <br>
  First, as seen most clearly in the embryonic <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  reconstruction, the organisation of the embryonic ventral cord motor 
  neurons was disturbed.  In particular a <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> process was seen to 
  switch across to the left side of the cord and send its commissure round to 
  the left rather than the right, and the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cells near this 
  point also sent their commissures round the opposite side to normal.  The 
  switch of the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> process to the left 
  cord confirms that <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  must normally grow out before the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> ventral cord 
  processes.  In the adult <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  reconstruction the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB3;class=Cell">DB3</a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD2;class=Cell">DD2</a> 
  cells show abnormal process organisation.  These effects would seem to be a 
  direct consequence of the absence of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, 
  because the outgrowth of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> processes and motor 
  neuron commissures follow directly after the outgrowth of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>. 
  The postembryonic motor neurons do not seem so badly affected as the 
  embryonic neurons, although the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=VD3;class=Cell">VD3</a> 
  process in the adult reconstruction is switched from being on the right 
  side to the left.  <br>
  <br>
  The second effect of removal of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, 
  seen in the adult reconstruction, is a general disorganisation of the cord 
  in which instead of a large ordered bundle on the right side and a very 
  small one on the left there are several intermediate sized bundles at 
  various positions on the left and right sides (figure 4.1).  This indicates 
  that <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  is ultimately necessary for correct organisation of the interneurons as 
  well as motor neurons, whose disarray appears earlier.  However <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  does not seem to be necessary for outgrowth of processes, since the total 
  number of processes in a cross section of the experimental adult cord is 
  within the expected range, and all the fully reconstructed cells send out 
  processes in the correct direction, if not on the correct side.  <br>
  <br>
  It is also clear that <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  is not the sole determining influence for the left/right organisation of 
  the ventral cord, because in the embryonic experimental reconstruction all 
  the early interneurons from the back were growing forward correctly <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a>,

  <a class=cell

  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
  on the right, and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  on the left).  Also in the adult <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  reconstruction the majority of processes was at all times on the right, 
  including the motor control interneurons (<a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVAL;class=Cell">AVAL</a>/<a

  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVDR;class=Cell">AVDR</a> 
  and <a class=cell

  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVER;class=Cell">AVER</a>). 
   In the only positively identified case of interneurons growing on the 
  wrong side, both <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVFL;class=Cell">AVFL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVFR;class=Cell">AVFR</a>'s 
  were seen to grow on the left (they are normally both on the right, figure 
  4.1).  <br>
  <br>
  The fact that removal of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  leads to no major behavioural defect suggests that it has no critical 
  function of its own.  In the adult reconstruction, although it is a fairly 
  large cell, it has been seen to make very few connections to other neurons, 
  the only consistent ones being large gap junctions to the two <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFL;class=Cell">RIFL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFR;class=Cell">RIFR</a> 
  interneurons and a small amount of synaptic input from the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PHAL;class=Cell">PHAL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PHAR;class=Cell">PHAR</a> 
  phasmid neurons (probably chemosensory) (White <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  It 
  has been postulated to be a sensory receptor itself on the basis of its 
  adult extension beyond the dorsorectal ganglion into the tail, although no 
  ultrastructural specialisation is seen there (ibid.).  One might instead 
  speculate that its main function is developmental.  If one considers that 
  it is just as important for a nervous system to be able to build itself as 
  to function correctly in the end, it makes sense that there be selective 
  pressure for neurons important in development even if they serve little or 
  no purpose in the final circuitry.  Another candidate for such a cell in 
  the <i>C. elegans</i>  nervous system is <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVT;class=Cell">PVT</a>. 
  This is a large cell demarcating the front of the preanal ganglion and 
  forming the most anterior link between the rectal epithelium and the 
  ventral ectoderm, which has no observed synaptic output and only a couple 
  of possible inputs.  However no experiments have been performed to test the 
  suggestion that it too may be primarily involved in developmental 
  organisation.  Of course one should beware of suggesting that every neuron 
  must have a major function; it is quite likely that there are also 
  redundant cells present that are not particularly important at any time.  
  <br>
  <br>
  The disarray seen in the ventral cord of the adult <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  reconstruction is very reminiscent of that seen in a reconstruction of a 
  mutant in the gene <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-3;class=Locus"><I>unc-3 
  (e151)</I></a>(figure 4.1, J G White, E Southgate and N Thomson, 
  unpublished results).  In that case too there were several subbundles, 
  looking very similar to those of the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  reconstruction; the majority of processes were on the right, including the 
  identifidable cluster of major motor interneurons which again retained 
  their internal organisation, but not their relative position in the bundle.  
  The defect appears to be restricted to the ventral cord since the nerve 
  ring was correctly organised according to several electron mircoscopic 
  criteria, bu the phenotype of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-3;class=Locus"><I>unc-3</I></a> 
   mutants is much more severe than that after ablation of the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  parent, and indeed in the reconstruction of the mutant it appeared that 
  some postembryonic motor neurons might be missing or not properly made.  
  <br>
  <br>
  There are two other uncoordianted genes for which mutants show relevant 
  defects.  The <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VD</a> commissures can be 
  visualised by immunocytochemical staining with antibodies against the 
  neurotransmitter GABA (helping to confirm that the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VD</a> classes are probably 
  GABAergic and inhibitory); they normally all grow to the right. However in 
  mutants for <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-71;class=Locus"><I>unc-71(e451)</I></a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-73;class=Locus"><I>unc-73(e936)</I></a> 
  a significant proportion of the commissures grow round the left side of the 
  animal (25% and 35% respectively; S McIntire, pers.  Comm.). The ventral 
  cord is also seen to be disorganised, in that in some places in the cord 
  the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VD</a> 
  and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> 
  processes, which normally run so close together that they are inseparable 
  by light microscopy, are clearly separated.  It would be interesting to see 
  what happens in early ventral cord development, particularly to <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, 
  in all of these mutants.  <br>
  <br>
  The suggestion derived from the reconstructions of the adult <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  animal and the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-3;class=Locus"><I>unc-3</I></a> 
  mutant that left/right pairs of processes tend to stick together may be 
  significant.  When the lumbar neuronal processes meet in the PAG at the 
  bottom of the lumbar commissures they "zip" together, each process in 
  contact with its homologue, except for <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> which remain apart (figure 
  3.9).  Eventually <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> end up on separate sides of the cord, while the 
  others all stay together on the right side.  This affinity of a process for 
  its opposite homologue provides a simple mechanism to ensure that processes 
  stay together.  Then perhaps only a slight bias is needed to send the pair 
  to one side rather than the other.  The experiments in which the parents of 
  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  cells were ablated reveal an underlying preference for the right side in at 
  least one case.  When <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  was removed <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> crossed to the right side rather than grew along the left 
  side of the cord by itself, but when <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
  was removed <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> still grew along the right side.  It may be that the 
  presence of preexisting fibres on the right rather than the left was the 
  determining factor in this particular case, but after <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>,

  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
  have grown out on the right side, which might prove sufficient to continue 
  to attract later arrivals.  <br>
  <br>
  To return to Meissner's suggestion the the primitive ventral nerve was 
  double, it may be worth discussing the advantages and disadvantages of a 
  fused cord over paired nerves.  The obvious disadvantage of a single cord 
  like that of <i>C. elegans</i>  is the loss of possible left/right control 
  over body movement.  Although there are four bands of muscle in <i>C. 
  elegans</i>  both ventral quadrants receive the same input from the right 
  hand ventral cord, as do both dorsal quadrants from the single dorsal cord.  
  Therefore the body of the animal moves only in the dorsal/ventral plane, 
  although the head can and does move freely in all directions. However there 
  are extra cross connecting motor neuron and interneuronal classes in the 
  head, and it is likely that in order to obtain reasonable left/right 
  coordination, something similar would be needed in the body.  There is no 
  sign of this, even in vestigial form.  On the other hand, if, as seems 
  likely, the putative primitive twin-nerved ancestor did not have the 
  capability for left/right body control (I have found no mention of any 
  nematode that does), then there is a strong case for bringing the motor 
  circuitry elements together in one nerve.  First it allows an effective 
  halving of the number of motor neurons; with the system as it is in <i>C. 
  elegans</i>  there is only one active motor neuron of each class at each 
  cross section of the body.  Second it removes at source any loss of 
  synchrony between wave generation on the left and right sides of the body.  
  Third it provides back up in an extremely important part of the animal's 
  nervous system by having twofold redundancy of each motor circuitry driving 
  interneuron.  However there is no obvious reason why the interneurons not 
  involved in the motor circuitry should join together or not, since they 
  serve no function in the cord but merely use it as a route from one end of 
  the cord to the other. Indeed this view is supported by the fact that a 
  minority of three apparently unrelated classes (<a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKL;class=Cell">AVKL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a>,

  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a>) 
  are still bilateral in <i>C. elegans</i> .  <br>
  <br>
  In conclusion I would like to speculate that the primitive nematode ventral 
  cord was double and symmetric, and that the selection pressure for the 
  currently more common asymmetric cord came from the motor circuitry.  It 
  appears that <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  plays a critical role in organising the left/right asymmetry of the motor 
  neurons.  An important factor for the interneurons appears to be the mutual 
  affinity of left/right pairs (and of the motor circuitry interneuron 
  classes for each other, since they preserve their approximate relative 
  structure under perturbation by <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  parent ablation and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-3;class=Locus"><I>unc-3</I></a> 
  mutation).  The interneuron pairs of groups may then tend to go to the 
  right side either directly or under the influence of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, 
  the motor neurons, or other previously determined processes, such as that 
  of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVA;class=Cell">DVA</a>. 
  If this picture is correct then the fact that so many left/right pairs of 
  non-motor circuitry interneurons also join up and grow together on the 
  right would suggest that, even in situations like this where all the cells 
  are individually distringuishable, neural guidance may be often controlled 
  by non-specific factors that affect a large number of neurons.

  <p class=boxed>
  The preceding section described how the presence of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  appears to help determine the side of the cord that the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> processes grow 
  along.  A second question concerns how the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> processes growing 
  along the ventral cord know where to stop and send out their commissures.  
  Although they have short posterior processes, the main <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> ventral cord 
  processes extend forward from the cell bodies, eventually making contact 
  with the next <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> cell along.  However 
  there is a certain amount of evidence to suggest that the determining 
  factor for <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> ventral cord growth 
  may not be the next <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> cell, but the 
  position of the next <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cell body. First the 
  <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> 
  commissures always exit from next to <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cell bodies, even 
  when these are not immediately behind the next <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> cell (e.g. <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD3;class=Cell">DD3</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB4;class=Cell">DB4</a> 
  in figure 3.4).  Second there often seems to be some sort of recognition 
  event involving <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> process tips 
  inserting themselves into <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cells at the time of 
  and soon after process outgrowth, particularly at the back of the cord 
  (figure 3.12). Third, in Acaris, where distances are much greater, all the 
  <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> 
  commissures exit opposite <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cell bodies together 
  with <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> 
  commissures, which are all on the right hand side behind the RBG (Johnson 
  and Stretton, 1987).  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VD</a> and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">AS</a> commissures also 
  grow out together in Ascaris (ibid.).  Neighbouring <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VD</a> and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">AS</a> cells are sisters, 
  but there is no lineal relationship whatsoever between <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> cells (in <i>C. 
  elegans</i> , and presumably also in Ascaris, whose early lineage is 
  identical to that of <i>C. elegans</i> , Sulston <i>et al.</i>, 1983).  
  Fourth, after <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD3;class=Cell">DD3</a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD5;class=Cell">DD5</a> 
  were removed by ablating their parent, <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD4;class=Cell">DD4</a> 
  did not extend to fill the whole space left by <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD3;class=Cell">DD3</a>, 
  but instead stopped and began sending out a commissure at an only very 
  slightly anterior position to normal (figure 4.3).  This experiment does 
  not prove <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> involvement, 
  however, because it remains possible that the normal growth length is 
  intrinsically determined, as appears to be the case with the postembryonic 
  touch cells <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVM;class=Cell">AVM</a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVM;class=Cell">PVM</a> 
  (Chalfie <i>et al.</i>, 1983).  A more conclusive, but unperformed, 
  experiment would be to remove a <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cell.  <br>
  <br>
  The next event after <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> process outgrowth is 
  the growth of the motor neuron commissures.  All the commissures grow out 
  synchonously and reach the dorsal midline at the same time, well before any 
  other longitudinal process has grown along the dorsal cord (<a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RID;class=Cell">RID</a> 
  will do so eventually).  There is therefore a problem of recognising the 
  correct point at which to turn, and a subsequent problem of deciding the 
  direction in which to turn.  Although adjacent to the basement membrance, 
  the commissural growth cones appear to grow on the surface of the 
  hypodermis, rather than the basement membrane (section 3.2).  Similar 
  behaviour was inferred from experiments on early optic nerve outgrowth 
  (Krayanek and Goldberg, 1981).  When the growth cones reach the dorsal 
  ridge they have been seen to insert finger-like extensions into the 
  hypodermis, indicating that some cell recognition event may have taken 
  place (figure 3.11). Therefore it seems that the best candidate for the 
  source of the required information is the dorsal hypodermal ridge itself, 
  and that the growth cone "tastes" the hypodermis as it advances, eventually 
  recognising the dorsal ridge.  <br>
  <br>
  The suggestion that there is a specific property of the dorsal hypodermal 
  ridge that is recognised, while simplifying the explanation of how the 
  dorsal cord is formed, creates problems of its own.  The dorsal hypodermis 
  is a syncytium containing many nuclei and covering the dorsal side of the 
  animal from head to tail and from one lateral ridge to ther other (the 
  lateral boundaries can be seen in the section in figure 1.1).  The 
  commissure therefore grows on the surface of this syncytium for some time 
  before it recognises a specific part of it.  In so doing it crosses the 
  path of some later longitudinal nerves, such as the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ALML;class=Cell">ALML</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ALMR;class=Cell">ALMR</a> 
  process, and the sublateral bundle (<a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SAAD;class=Cell">SAAD</a>, 
  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SABD;class=Cell">SABD</a>,

  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SMDDR;class=Cell">SMDDR</a>, 
  see figure 1.2).  Hence it appears that some property of the membrane must 
  be localised to only that part of the cell surface covering the dorsal 
  ridge.  The syncytium is formed in the embryo in a curious fashion by two 
  rows of cells passing between each other and then fusing.  Mutations in two 
  genes, <a class=cell  
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-83;class=Locus"><I>unc-83</I></a> 
  and <a class=cell  
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-84;class=Locus"><I>unc-84</I></a>, 
  are known to affect this process (Sulston and Horvitz, 1982).  Although 
  mutant L1 larvae move well, they have been seen in electron microscope 
  reconstructions to contain defects in the structure of the dorsal cord (J. 
  G. White, unpublished observation), which might be due to the failure in 
  the correct localisation of recognition components in the dorsal hypodermal 
  ridge.  <br>
  <br>
  Once the motor neurons have turned onto the dorsal cord, they seem to grow 
  out rapidly along it and, if they are <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> or <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> neurons, start 
  making neuromuscular junctions (D reconstruction, figure 3.6).  It is only 
  at around this time or later that their dendrites grow out in the ventral 
  cord, so they start neuromuscular activity receiving organised synaptic 
  input. A system in which neurons generate synaptic activity before they 
  receive their controlling input would be expected to generate a lot of 
  random signals, but would allow the whole nervous system to be built 
  simultaneously instead of sequentially, starting with sensory neurons and 
  progressing along the processing pathway.

  <p class=boxed>
  Decussation of nerve processes, in which an entire group of cell processes 
  cross the midline, is a standard phenomenon in most animal nervous systems, 
  and a scaled down version of the same type of behaviour can be seen in 
  <i>C. elegans</i>  in the crossing over of processes from paired 
  interneurons in the preanal and retrovesicular ganglia.  The <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  processes cross in the PAG (figure 3.8) and the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFL;class=Cell">RIFL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFR;class=Cell">RIFR</a>, 
  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIG;class=Cell">RIG</a> 
  and SABV processes cross in the RVG (figure 3.10).  Since the general 
  property of decussation appears to be functionally unnecessary, it may give 
  some insight into general constraints on developmental organisation.  <br>
  <br>
  It is very clear in <i>C. elegans</i>  that there is no ultimate functional 
  advantage to be gained from the decussation.  The crossovers are not used 
  to facilitate transfer of information from one side of the nervous system 
  to the other by receiving input on one side and having output on the other, 
  since in almost every case all the synapses and gap junctions observed in 
  the adult wild type reconstructions are on the parts of the processes 
  beyond the cross over point.  The exception is that the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFL;class=Cell">RIFL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFR;class=Cell">RIFR</a> 
  cells both make gap junctions to <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  on their cell bodies, but this also would not be logically different if the 
  cell body positions were reversed.  It is not even the case that the 
  symmetrical body positions of the neurons involved are preserved into later 
  development; in fact the cell bodies in both the PAG and the RVG get 
  squashed into a single row as the muscles mature.  <br>
  <br>
  This situation is different from that in most vertebrate decussations, in 
  which the cells remain on the opposite side from their axonal termini, and 
  have some functionality on both sides.  However, even there it is clear 
  that, considering the whole organism, there is more crossing over than is 
  necessary.  An engineer would have the right side of the brain receive 
  information from, and control, the right side of the body.  Some 
  communication between the two dies is certainly necessary, and this is seen 
  for example in the corpus callosum between the two hemispheres of the 
  cerebral cortex (and in the C. elegans nerve ring).  However such 
  connections are inherently different from the general sensory and motor 
  decussations, for which the argument can still be made that they are 
  functionally necessary, and are more likely to reflect developmental than 
  functional constraints.  <br>
  <br>
  One common factor between the four miniature examples of decussation in the 
  PAG and RVC of <i>C. elegans</i> is that they are all between pairs of 
  neurons touching across the ventral midline.  It might be suggested that 
  their mutual affinity causes their processes to grow towards the opposite 
  cell, and therefore cross over.  However after either <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
  or <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  was removed by ablating its parent the other stayed in position and still 
  sent its process across the midline and along the opposite side of the cord 
  as normal.  In addition there are three pairs of cells in the ventral 
  ganglion in front of the excretory duct which are also adjacent across the 
  midline (<a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAL;class=Cell">AIAL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAR;class=Cell">AIAR</a>, 
  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SMBVL;class=Cell">SMBVL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SMBVR;class=Cell">SMBVR</a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SAAD;class=Cell">SAAD</a>) 
  and none of them cross over.  Instead the simplest unifying property of the 
  decussating pairs is regional: they comprise all the left/right pairs of 
  interneurons associated with the ventral hypodermal ridge between the 
  excretory duct and the anus.  This, however, suggests neither a mechanism 
  nor a reason for the crossing over.  <br>
  <br>
  One possibility is that the crossing is ballistic: both processes are 
  attracted to some point or region on the midline and once they get there 
  they keep on growing in the same direction and thus cross over.  Nerve 
  processes in vitro tend to grow in straight lines (Bray, 1979).  The 
  attraction of the ballistic hypothesis is that it permits there to be no 
  intrinsic distinction between the two cells.  The fact that all the 
  decussating pairs in the RVG cross in the same place supports the 
  hypothesis.  Also the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  crossing point in the PAG seems to be special, since the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
  process crosses from top left to bottom right in the same place, on its way 
  forward through the preanal ganglion.  The change in position of <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
  does not define the site, because removal of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
  by ablating its parent had no effect on the <a class=cell

  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  processes and their crossover.  Neither did removal of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>, 
  which normally contacts <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  as soon as it crosses to the left and grows forward with it.  <br>
  <br>
  If we accept the ballistic hypothesis then it seems likely that <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVT;class=Cell">PVT</a> 
  defines the site in the preanal ganglion, since the <a class=cell

  class=cell

  neurons, which are flattend out over the surface of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a>, 
  partially separating the <a class=cell

  cells from <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a> 
  (figure 3.8). Alternatively it may be that the site is defined by the <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> 
  processes in a redundant manner, so that removal of any one of them makes 
  no difference.  The affinity of these three processes for the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a> 
  cell body is striking; they spread over its surface whereever it is 
  available, and when <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
  was removed the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> 
  processes spread further to mostly fill the gap (figure 4.7). Further 
  experimentation removing either <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVT;class=Cell">PVT</a> 
  or <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a> 
  might prove illuminating.  <br>

  A variant of the ballistic hypothesis is that the initial directions of 
  outgrowth of the processes are both intrinsically towards the midline, and 
  so the processes simply cross over before turning forward.  All the cells 
  involved migrate ventrally from lateral positions as the hypodermis closes 
  over the ventral surface of the embryo.  It might be that the growth cones 
  start out continuing the direction of migration of the cell and thus cross 
  the ventral midline.  This argument would apply equally well to the ventral 
  ganglion cell pairs that do not cross, and it is certainly not necessary 
  for an axon to leave a cell body in the same direction that the cell has 
  been migrating.  For example the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ALML;class=Cell">ALML</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ALMR;class=Cell">ALMR</a> 
  cell bodies are seen migrating backward along the lateral hypodermis in the 
  C and D reconstructions, and in the E reconstruction they are sending axons 
  forward along the same path they have just followed but in the opposite 
  direction (figure 3.4).  However, even if this does not provide a complete 
  explanation, it does suggest how intrinsic opposite polarities of the two 
  cells in each pair may be established.

  I have already suggested that <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  helps organise the ventral cord by providing a preferential parth for 
  growth of, at the least, the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> axons.  The wildtype 
  outgrowth of <a class=cell

  processes from the back of the cord, in which their tips always were found 
  very close together along the cord (section 3.5), suggested that there 
  might be some interaction involved. Therefore a series of ablation 
  experiments were performed to investigate <a class=cell

  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> 
  processes grow on both sides of the ventral cord.  The left hand cord 
  contains only three processes at hatching, <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a>, 
  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>, and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a> 
  (plus <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RMEV;class=Cell">RMEV</a> 
  at the front, see fig.  1.3).  The normal sequence of events is that <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> grow forward together, and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a> 
  was only seen to be growing back after they had reached the front.  It 
  appears that <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  is needed for the other two to grow on the left side, because when it is 
  removed no processes are seen n either the embryonic or adult left hand 
  cords (figure 4.4). If <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> is removed then <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  still grows forward along the cord by itself.  Therefore, although <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> is 
  not a unique pioneer in normal development because the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> growing tip is 
  parallel with its own, it does appear to have a primary role in 
  establishing the left hand cord.  When VPR is removed the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> process 
  still grows forward along the cord, but on the right side rather than the 
  left, and apparently somewhat delayed compared to <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
  which normally grow on the right.  In this case therefore the ability to 
  grow and the basic directionality of growth are preserved, although the 
  actual path taken was altered, as when <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  was removed.  This corresponds to what is seen when guideposts are removed 
  in the insect PNS (Berlot and Goodman, 1984), or motor neurons in the 
  chinck embryo (Landmesser and Honig, 1986).  It is not known whether the <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a> 
  process also extended along the right hand cord in the absence of <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> on the left side. <br>
  <br>
  These results are not symmetrically reproducible on the other side of the 
  ventral cord, since <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> still grows forward along the right side in the 
  absence of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>. 
  However, as discussed above, the cord is not symmetrical.  While <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> and 
  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> are the first processes to grow along the left side of the cord, there 
  are other preexisting processes on the right at the time when <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> grows 
  forward (<a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> 
  axons) which might provide some degree of non-specific affinity that 
  assisted <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> in growing along the right side.  This could in principle be 
  tested by removing <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>, 
  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a>. 
   <br>
  <br>
  Although the removal of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> had no effect on the outgrowth of <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
  along the left hand ventral cord, it did appear to affect the growth of 
  other processes down the lumbar commissure from the left lumbar ganglion to 
  the preanal ganglion (see figure 1.3 for a schematic plan of the normal 
  situation).  In neither of the reconstructed embryos in which <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> had been 
  removed did any of the left lumbar processes grow down lumbar commissure, 
  although they had done so on the right side.  As well as containing 
  processes descending from the lumbar ganglion, the lumbar commissures 
  contian a <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> motor neuron process 
  ascending from the preanal ganglion.  This was present in both the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>
  reconstructions.  <br>
  <br>
  These results suggest that there is a specific need for <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> in order for 
  the other lumbar ganglion cells to grow correctly in the right direction.  
  Similar behaviour is seen in the developing grasshopper CNS, where in 
  several cases it has been shown that an identified neuronal growth cone 
  normally fasciculates with a specific preexisting fascicle, in the absence 
  of which it fails to grow in any organised fashion (Raper <i>et al.</i>, 
  1984, Bastiani <i>et al.</i>, 1986, duLac <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  In one 
  case it was shown that a specific subset of the processes in the 
  preexisting fascicle is required (Raper <i>et al.</i>, 1984).  This 
  corresponds to the observation that the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> process in the 
  lumbar commissure is not sufficient to promote growth of other processes 
  down the commissure.  <br>
  <br>
  If <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> provides guidance for the left lumbar processes by some process of 
  selective fasciculation, then this fasciculation does not last for long.  
  When processes from the two lumbar commissures meet in the preanal ganglion 
  all the cell types other than <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> 
  immediately form contact with their bilateral homologues, "zipping up" with 
  each other (figure 3.8). The other left lumbar processes then leave <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> to 
  join their right hand homologues and <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> on the right hand side.  
  Therefore it seems that there is a hierarchy of affinities that applies the 
  left lumbar processes other than <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>; first they follow, and in fact 
  require, <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>, then they leave <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> in order to join their right hand 
  homologues.  <br>
  <br>
  These observations all fit the "labelled pathways" hypothesis (Ghysen and 
  Jansen, 1979, Goodman <i>et al.</i>, 1982), that growth cones are 
  programmed to recognise a sequence of surface labels on fascicles, possibly 
  in some adhesive hierarchy, and that this determines their path through the 
  developing nervous system.  The situation when the left and right lumbar 
  processes meet is somewhat novel, in that then two equivalent sets of 
  processes fasciculate together, and must decide which of the two <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> 
  neurons to follow.  There is no good clue as to what determines this 
  (discussed earlier in the section on cord asymmetry.  <br>
  <br>
  The observations about lumbar commissure formation contrast with those made 
  in the ventral cord that, even if normal cues are missing, processes tend 
  to keep on growing in the correct direction.  A plausible explanation of 
  this difference is tat there is a non specific property of the ventral cord 
  which permits or promotes neuron growth along it.  Apart from the presence 
  of other processes, at the relevant time there is a continuous line of 
  motor neuron cell bodies along the ventral midline, which may act as 
  general guideposts in the same way as neuronal cell bodies that have been 
  proposed to facilitate neuron outgrowth in the insect PNS (Bentley and 
  Keshishian, 1982). <br>
  <br>
  There are a number of uncoordinated mutants that are known to be defective 
  in outgrowth of processes from the lumbar ganglion cells, on the basis of 
  fluorescent staining of the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PHAL;class=Cell">PHAL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PHAR;class=Cell">PHAR</a> 
  and <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PHBL;class=Cell">PHBL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PHBR;class=Cell">PHBR</a> 
  phasmid sensory neurons by direct uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate 
  (Hedgecock <i>et al.</i>, 1985).  Mutants in <a class=cell  
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-33;class=Locus"><I>unc-33</I></a>, 
  <a class=cell  
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-44;class=Locus"><I>unc-44</I></a> 
  and <a class=cell  
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-76;class=Locus"><I>unc-76</I></a> 
  all show the same phenotype.  Rather than growing forward into the preanal 
  ganglion the phasmid axons stop abruptly where they meet at the bottom of 
  the lumbar commissures, often with swollen endings.  This is at the point 
  where the resorting of the fibres takes place, with the majority of the 
  left lumbar processes leaving <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> to grow forward with their contralateral 
  homologues.  The fact that there are several genes with both this phenotype 
  and also defects in movement is interesting in relation to a suggestion 
  made earlier (in the discussion of ventral cord asymmetry).  This proposed 
  that the mutual affinity of ventral cord bilateral homologues may be a 
  basic general mechanism whose biological purpose is to bring together the 
  motor circuitry interneurons, and which affects other neurons incidentally.  
  A prediction of this hypothesis would be that the anterior motor circuitry 
  interneurons would also be afected by the mutations.  In mutants for <a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-6;class=Locus"><I>unc-6</I></a> 
  (referred to as <a class=cell   
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-106;class=Locus"><I>unc-106</I></a> 
  in Hedgecock <i>et al.</i>), the <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PHAL;class=Cell">PHAL</a>/<a 
  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PHAR;class=Cell">PHAR</a>

  class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PHBR;class=Cell">PHBR</a> 
  axons normally fail to grow down the lumbar commissures, but instead wander 
  forward along the lateral hypodermis.  This is reminiscent of the defect 
  seen in the left lumbar commissure when <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> was removed.  However the 
  defect in <a class=cell  
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-6;class=Locus"><I>unc-6</I></a> 
  mutants is more general than that following <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> removal, since axons from 
  the postembryonic <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVD;class=Cell">PVD</a> 
  neurons on the lateral hypodermis also fail to reach the ventral cord, and 
  motor neuron commissures are also disrupted (S McIntire, personal 
  communication).

  <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc5.6"> 5.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</H3>
  
  <p class=boxed>
  In the introduction to this part of the dissertation it was proposed that a 
  number of different mechanisms could be used to influence neuronal 
  guidance, often concurrently, and a list of possible types and sources of 
  influence was provided.  The behaviour of outgrowing neurites in both 
  normal and experimental <i>C. elegans</i>  embryos that has been described 
  here has suggested new examples of several different types of influence.  
  <br>
  <br>
  The formation of the dorsal cord could be explained by the presence of a 
  preexisting preferred pathway along the dorsal hypodermal ridge. This would 
  essentially be an epidermal blueprint, as proposed by Singer <i>et al.</i>  
  (1979).  <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> growth along the 
  ventral cord may be limited by some inhibitory effect of <a class=cell 
  href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cells, although from 
  the observations that are available the inhibition seems more likely to be 
  caused by selective recognition accompanied by membrane insertion than by 
  the retraction of growth cones as seen by Kampfhammer <i>et al.</i>  (1986) 
  in vitro.  The decussation of processes in the preanal and retrovesicular 
  ganglia may be due to the tendency of growth cones to grow in straight 
  lines, as discussed by Bray (1979).  In the lumbar commissures and the 
  determination of which processes grow along the left and right nerve cords 
  there appear to be several examples of selective fasciculation, similar to 
  that proposed in the labelled pathways hypothesis (Ghysen and Jansen, 
  1979).  There also appeared to be a general directionally or premissive 
  property of the ventral cord region that meant that, even when specific 
  cues were removed, processes still grew out along the cord.  <br>
  <br>
  All these proposed interactions fall broadly into some class of interaction 
  that has been suggested previously.  Further experiments of the same type 
  as described here, some of which I have mentioned in the discussion, could 
  be carried out to define more precisely the characteristics of particular 
  interactions.  The other possible approach to furthe rwork is to use the 
  existing picture as a basis for an investigation of the genetic factors 
  controlling neural outgrowth, eventually uncovering the critical molecular 
  mechanisms involved using molecular genetic techniques (Greenwald, 1985).  
  In this discussion I have mentioned a number of mutants that affect neural 
  guidance in the ventral nervous system, in some cases in ways that are 
  partially interpretable in terms of the mechanisms proposed here.  The 
  genetic approach is discussed further in the final conclusion after part 
  II.
