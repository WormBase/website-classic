6.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</H3>
   <p class=boxed>Around the beginning of this century several attempts were
   made to map all the nerve processes in a nematode nervous system,
   using light microscopy of methylene blue stained animals, most
   notably by Goldschmidt (1908), who argued erroneously that a
   nervous system was a syncytial network of anastomatosed cells. 
   That view was soon disproved, but it was not until recently that
   the goal was realised of determining the anatomical structure of a
   complete nervous system at the level of individual processes and
   synaptic connections (White <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  As part of that
   achievement the entire central nervous system of two <i>C. elegans</i> 
   specimens was reconstructed from electron micrographs of serial
   sections.  The purpose of the investigation reported here was to
   extract information about the organisational structure of the C.
   elegans nervous system from the resulting anatomical data,
   concentrating in particular on the syaptic circuitry.  <br><br>The
   approach taken was to construct a computer database containing
   information about all the synapses and gap junctions between the
   neurons, and also form one animal an indication of the amount of
   contact between each pair of neurons.  This information was used
   for three separate lines of investigation.  The first was to study
   the distribution of symapses within the nervous system in order to
   investigate the variability of the circuitry in different
   circumstances, and the type of variation seen, and to use that
   variability to make inferences about possible factors involved in
   determining whether connections are made.  This work is described
   in Chapter 7.  The second line of study, described in Chapter 8,
   considered the general organisational structure of the synaptic
   circuitry, and how it might relate to function.  The third,
   described in Chapter 9, used the data on the contact between
   neurons to investigate the physical organisation of nerve processes
   in the neuropil.  <br><br>The date for all these investigations are
   purely anatomical; there are no physiological studies on the nerve
   ring neurons in either <i>C. elegans</i>  or Ascaris.  Some of the
   functional circuitry involved in the motion response to a touch
   stimulus in <i>C. elegans</i>  has been deduced by a combination of laser
   ablation experiments and the detailed anatomy (Chalfie <i>et al.</i>,
   1986).  However practically all of the discussion concering
   possible function of parts of the ring circuitry has to be based on
   the electron microscope anatomical data showing sensory endings,
   synapses and gap junctions, and motor output onto muscle.  As will
   be shown in Chapter 8, there are some fairly broad statements that
   can be made about the organisation of connections at the level of
   the whole nervous sytem, or groups of neuronal classes, but caution
   must be exercised in interpreting plausible connectivity patterns
   in any detail.  In particular no attempt is made to predict the
   inhibitory or excitatory nature of particular synaptic connections,
   or to stimulate, even conceptually, any piece of circuitry.  <br><br>
   The type of study undertaken here is novel because the data
   available are unique in their completeness at such a fine level of
   detail.  There have been many studies of circuitry at the
   physiological level in other animals (research on a number of well
   defined invertebrate systems is reviewed in Selverston, 1985) and
   it is often possible to dye fill the neurons from which recordings
   have been made to determine their anatomy at the light microscope
   level.  However the overall distribution of connectivity between
   all the different identified neurons in even a part of a central
   nervous system has not previously been analysed at an electron
   microscopic level, owing largely to the much greater complexity of
   other animals' nervous tissue.  Perhaps the system about which most
   is known is the vertebrate retina, which has been studied in detail
   at both a physiological and electron microscope level (Dowling and
   Boycott, 1966, McGuire <i>et al.</i>, 1986, reviewed in Sterling, 1983). 
   Around 50 types of cell falling into a few basic classes have been
   identified, and much is known about typical connections between
   these cell types.  However particular cells and situations are not
   reproducible and electron microscope studies have necessarily
   concentrated on the properties of single cells (McGuire <i>et al.</i>,
   1986).  </p>

6.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Methods</H3>
   <p class=boxed>Data from two electron microscope reconstructions, the H
   series and the U series of White <i>et al.</i>  (1986), were used to
   construct a computer database.  The part of the animal that is
   represented in the database is the whole of the central processing
   region, or nerve ring, which consists of a ring of neuropil around
   the pharynx in the head of the animal that contains about 175 nerve
   fibres and the bast majority of the synapses in the entire nervous
   system.  A general description of the <i>C. elegans</i>  nervous system can
   be found in Chapter 1.  Chapter 2 introduces the nomenclature of C.
   elegans neurons.  The database contains the following information
   about the nerve processes in the ring: for each pair of neurons it
   stores the number of gap junctions between them and the number of
   chemical synapses in each direction.  In addition, for the H
   series, there is a measure of the adjacency or degree of mutual
   contact between each pair of processes.  This adjacency was
   obtained by looking at every 5th micrograph in the reconstruction
   series and counting the number of these pictures on which the given
   pair of neurons were in contact.  <br><br>The word synapse is
   reserved for chemical synapses in this discussion; electrical
   connections are referred to as gap junctions because they are
   identified as such from the electron micrographs.  White <i>et al.</i> 
   (1986) presents the criteria used in identifying synapses and gap
   junctions in <i>C. elegans</i>  electron microscope reconstructions. 
   Synapses are made en passant between adjacent processes.  Although
   synaptic boutons are not seen, synapses can be recognised in
   electron micrographs by the presence of presynaptic density and the
   accumulation of vesicles.  The chemical synapse count in the
   database combines data from monadic and dyadic synapses.  In dyadic
   synapses, which are seen frequently in <i>C. elegans</i> , there are two
   postsynaptic partners.  It excludes cases where the only connection
   seen between two cells is half a dyadic synapse, since such
   observations have been seen to be unreliable.  <br><br>In general
   throughout the presentation and discussion of results a distinction
   is made between a connection between two neurons, and a synapse
   between them.  There is a connection if there are one or more
   synapses.  All the results that do not concern comparison between
   the two different animals represented in the H and U series were
   obtained with data from the H series alone, because the adjacency
   information, which is only available for that animal, is often an
   important factor in the analysis.  For a general H series neuron,
   A, I will refer to its contralateral homologue as A', and to the
   corresponding in the U series as Au.  <br><br>The database program
   is written in C and implemented on a VAX-8600 minicomputer.  The
   main data is stored in a large array in virtual memory, together
   with a set of referencing arrays that allow easy access and cross
   comparison.  All the analysis softwre is contained in one program
   that is modular in design and uses a free format command input
   system developed previously (Durbin <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  An analysis
   requiring a new algorithm is implemented by writing a new
   subprogram and entering it as an option in the command tree. 
   <br><br>This investigation relies on much previous hard work by
   Nichol Thomson, Eileen Southgate, and John White in performing the
   original reconstructions, and crosschecking all the data.  I would
   also like to thank Barbara Cross and Mabel Eggo for assisting in
   typing some of the data into the computer.  </p>
