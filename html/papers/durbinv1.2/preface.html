   The work described in this dissertation was carried out between January 
   1984 and March 1987 at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge.  
   As described in the summary, two different approaches were used in this 
   work, and the main body of the dissertation is split into two parts, each 
   with its own introduction.  However the introduction to the first part 
   provides much of the general background.  There is a final conclusion which 
   considers both parts in a broader setting.

   <P>
   It is customary to list a long series of acknowledgements somewhere in the 
   preface to a dissertation.  I have derived enormous personal and scientific 
   benefit from my time spent at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, both 
   from the people who work here and the environment that they have created.  
   I am only going to thank personally two people, my supervisor John White, 
   to whom I owe so much that it would be pointless to try to encapsulate it, 
   and Nichol Thomson, who does all the serial sectioning of <i>C. 
   elegans</i> 
   at the MRC with remarkable consistency, and ultimately without whom none of 
   this work would have been possible.  I would also like to thank the Medical 
   Research Council for a Training Award, and King&#146;s College for a 
   Research Fellowship.
   </P>
   
   <P>
   With the exception of the technical serial sectioning for the first part, 
   this dissertation is the result of my own work and includes nothing which 
   is the outcome of work done in collaboration.  No part of this dissertation 
   has been or is being submitted to any other University.
