8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Logical Organisation of the Circuitry</H2>
   <p class=boxed>As well as looking at typical local interactions between
   neurons in the nerve ring the completeness of the information in
   the database allows us to investigate the large scale structure of
   the neural circuitry.  We can ask such questions as: what is the
   processing depth from sensory input to motor output, i.e. how many
   intermediary neurons are there?, and to what extent is the
   circuitry unidirectional, progressing linearly from input to
   output?  It is unlikely to be completely directional; one expects
   to find a certain amount of feedback, both in control-type
   circuits, in analogy to electrical engineering, where feedback can
   be used to adjust gain and bias to optimise the response to
   stimuli, and in rhythmic pattern generators if they exist.  In fact
   the questions of processing depth and directionality are related,
   since it is necessary to have ordered the circuit diagram before
   being able to count the number of intermediary neurons between
   sensory input at the top and motor output at the bottom.  I shall
   therefore consider first the extent to which the circuit diagram
   can be directionally ordered.</p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc8.1">
8.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Directionality</H3>
   <p class=boxed>Let us consider the network of chemical synapses and ignore
   gap junctions for the time being since, although they can be
   rectifying and directional, one can not detect any directionality
   from electron micrographs.  The aim is to vertically order the
   neurons so that as many as possible of the synapses point
   downwards, with their presynaptic neuron above the postsynatic
   neuron in the ordering.  This was done with a sorting algorithm
   that is described in the appendix.  <br><br>In fact the operation
   was carried out with combined data for neuronal classes, rather
   than with the individual cells, since all the members of the same
   class should occupy the same functional position in the circuitry. 
   Since the earlier analysis suggested that there was a core set of
   connections that were almost always present, to which were added a
   number of sporadic connections consisting of only one or two
   synapses, orderings were obtained for two sets of data, one made by
   adding all the synapses that were seen in at least three out of the
   four possible places (left and right sides in both H and U series). 
   In the latter case the few synapses between two unpaired cells were
   only counted if they appeared in both the H and the U series.  This
   more stringent synapse set is the same as the set of consistent
   synapses discussed in Chapter 7.  For ease of comparison the summed
   data were divided by two and the stringent data multiplied by two
   so that both sets gave numbers in terms of synapses per animal. 
   <br><br>The results suggest that on a large scale the circuitry is
   very directional, and that almost all the chemical synaptic
   feedback that does take place is in the form of reciprocal
   synapses.  The more stringent set of data could be arranged so that
   more than 95% of the connections pointed downward, leaving only
   140 out of 2890 (4.8%) pointing upward (figure 8.1).  Of these,
   116 were involved in reciprocal connections, which have to
   contribute upward synapses because they have synapses in both
   directions.  This leaves only 24 persistently seen synapses that
   are involved in upward connections, 12 per side.  These 12 synapses
   are distributed over 11 connections, so there is no case in the
   whole nerve ring of strong, consistently seen, indirect synaptic
   feedback.  However it appears that direct feedback using reciprocal
   connections is an important feature of the circuitry, since
   reciprocal connections contained 378 downward synapses as well as
   the 132 reverse synapses already mentioned, therefore accounting
   for 20% (494/2890) of the persistently observed synapses. </p>

   It was not possible to order the averaged data so clearly.  In that
   case there were 3898 synapses per animal, of which 386 (9.9%)
   pointed upwards in the arrangement that had been found to be best
   for the stringent data.  When the ordering was specifically
   optimised for the averaged data the number of upward synapses was
   only reduced to 328 (8.4%), nearly twice the percentage that was
   seen with the stringent data.  These observations support the
   suggestion made in Chapter 7 that at least a proportion of the
   additional synapses are different in nature from the consistently
   observed synapses, having perhaps a more random distribution.  </p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc8.2">
8.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The organisation of the feedback</H3>
   <p class=boxed>Several groups of neurons have been indicated in figure 8.1
   on subjective grounds because they seem to be involved in a
   particular part of the circuitry.  Two sensory and two motor
   groupings have been defined.  One contains neurons associated with
   the amphid sensilla, whicha re multiply innervated sensilla on
   either side at the front of the head, probably concerned mainly
   with chemo- and osmo-detection (Ward <i>et al.</i>, 1975).  As well as
   sensory receptor neurons there are a number of interneuron classes
   that appear to be predominantly concerned with processing
   information from these receptors.  The other sensory grouping
   contains a second set of neurons with sensory receptors at the
   front of the head, distinct from the amphids.  These all have their
   cell bodies in front of the nerve ring, and tend to form direct
   connections to motor circuitry (or directly to muscle in the cases
   of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>IL1</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>URA</a>).  There are additional sensory neurons, such as the
   touch neurons (<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ALML;class=Cell">ALML</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ALMR;class=Cell">ALMR</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVM;class=Cell">AVM</a>, Chalfie <i>et al.</i>, 1985) that are not
   assigned to either of these classes.  The two motor circuitry
   groupings contain the interneurons that innervate ventral cord
   motor neurons on the one hand, and some of the circuitry that
   controls neuromuscular activity onto head muscles from the nerve
   ring on the other hand.  <br><br>Figure 8.2 shows the amphid
   circuitry and part of the ring motor circuitry in greater detail,
   including all the synaptic connections.  Although there are several
   examples of reciprocal feedback they do not interlink the whole
   circuitry.  The groups of neuronal classes that are connected so
   that each neuron could potentially influence all the others in
   group are outlined in figure 8.2 (the connection between <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIVL;class=Cell">RIVL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIVR;class=Cell">RIVR</a> and
   <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>SAA</a> breaks this rule, but only contains one consistent synapse). 
   Let us call such groups "modules".  Neurons higher in the
   directional ordering are isolated from modules that lie below them. 
   Thus all the amphid circuitry apart from <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBL;class=Cell">AIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBR;class=Cell">AIBR</a> is isolated from motor
   activity.  In this sense even the reciprocal feedback that is seen
   only has a limited effect on the overall directionality of the
   circuitry.  <br><br>One important consideration that might
   invalidate the suggestion of a highly directed flow is that we have
   ignored gap junctions.  Figure 8.1 © shows the distribution of all
   the gap junctional connections in the nervous system.  Some of
   these are within groupings identified previously.  There are also
   some classes that make a lot of gap junctions, but very few
   chemical synapses (e.g. <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIG;class=Cell">RIG</a>, RMG, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKL;class=Cell">AVKL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a>).  It is of course not known
   whether or not any of these gap junctions are rectifying and thus
   possibly directional themselves.</p> <p class=boxed>However in at least one
   case a gap junctional connection has been shown to be functionally
   important in one direction, by removing the cell involved with a
   focussed laser beam (Chalfie <i>et al.</i>, 1985).</p>

      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc8.3">
8.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The processing depth</H3>
   <p class=boxed>The ordering of the circuitry allows us to count the number
   of synapses between sensory input and motor output.  The method
   used calculates a hypothetical flow of information through the
   synaptic connections down through the nervous system (see Appendix
   for details).  It necessarily treats all the observed synapses as
   having equal functional effect and so the resulting estimates are
   probably physiologically very inaccurate.  However they provide a
   reasonable basis for a broad comparison of the flow of information
   from different sensory modalities.  <br><br>There are on average 3.5
   chemical synapses between sensory neurons and the head muscles,
   basing the calculation on the more stringent data and the ordering
   derived for in in section 8.1.  As might be expected, there is a
   lot of variation in the number of intermediary connections.  The
   actual number can vary from a minimum of one in the case of
   neuromuscular output from the sensory motor neurons <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>IL1</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>URA</a> to
   a maximum of 16 for a particular sequence of synaptic connections
   starting from the amphid receptor <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ASIL;class=Cell">ASIL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ASIR;class=Cell">ASIR</a>. However this upper band is
   somewhat misleading; the average distance from muscle of any given
   neuronal class is never greater than 5.9 synapses (for <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ASJL;class=Cell">ASJL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=ASJR;class=Cell">ASJR</a>). 
   Nevertheless there is clear systematic variation dependent on the
   type of sensory receptor being considered.  Input from the amphid
   receptors takes the longest time on average to reach muscle (4.4
   synapses), reflecting the extra stage of amphid specific
   interneuron processing shown in figure 8.2.  The other head sensory
   input is rapid, taking only 2.2 synapses on average, and the
   average value for the remaining sensory neuronal classes is 3.2
   synapses.  <br><br>The same method that calculates depth of
   processing also generates an estimate of the proportion of &#223ensory
   influence" that reaches different final types of output (see the
   appendix for details).  There are three major discernible targets
   for output from the nerve ring: the head musculature via direct
   neuromuscular synapses, the ventral cord motor circuitry
   interneurons, and the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPL;class=Cell">RIPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPR;class=Cell">RIPR</a> class of neurons, which provide the sole
   connection to the pharyngeal nervous system, which is thought to
   pump constitutively unless repressed by <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPL;class=Cell">RIPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPR;class=Cell">RIPR</a>. In general the number
   of synapses connecting sensory neurons to the ventral cord
   circuitry or <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPL;class=Cell">RIPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPR;class=Cell">RIPR</a> is about one less than the number needed to reach
   the head musculature, possibly because there is an extra layer of
   motor pattern generating circuitry (considered further in the
   discussion).  The "fast" head sensory neurons have proportionally
   more output onto the head muscles, and provide the majority of
   output onto <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPL;class=Cell">RIPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPR;class=Cell">RIPR</a>. It seems reasonable to suggest that they carry out
   much of the short range sensing involved in moving the head to feed
   and searching out a path round obstacles for the body to follow
   when moving.  The amphids generate a balanced number of connections
   to both the head muscles and ventral cord interneurons, and have no
   link with <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPL;class=Cell">RIPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIPR;class=Cell">RIPR</a>. The other sensory neurons provide comparatively more
   input onto the ventral cord interneurons.  This is perhaps
   reasonable because many of their sensory endings are in various
   other parts of the body, rather than being at the tip of the head.

      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc8.4">
8.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion</H3>
   <p class=boxed>The strongest general feature of the <i>C. elegans</i>  nerve ring
   circuitry is its extremely high directionality.  The neuronal
   classes can be ordered in such a way that less than 5% of the
   synapses point backward.  This organisation is clearly very
   different from that of many higher organisms.  For example in the
   mammalian cortex every projection from one area of cortex to
   another seems to be matched by a reverse projection (van Essen,
   1979).  However there are also structures that are only a few
   synapses deep that seem to be fairly directional, such as the
   vertebrate retina (Sterling, 1983).  <br><br>Almost all the synapses
   that do point backward are members of reciprocal connections, which
   were shown in Chapter 7 to be almost as frequent as would be
   expected on the basis of the distribution of directed synapses. 
   There are almost no persistently seen synapses involved in indirect
   feedback.  In addition the feedback that is seen appears to be
   largely restricted to affecting small groups of neuronal classes,
   or modules.  In the case of the circuitry shown in figure 8.2 it is
   possible to suggest functions for the observed modules in terms of
   the different stages of processing needed.  However in discussing
   the possible function of elements of the circuitry one should bear
   in mind that all the data is anatomical; there is no functional or
   physiological data.  <br><br>The outputs of the amphid receptors
   shown in figure 8.2 appear to be processed fairly independently
   from the rest of the sensory input.  Their output is eventually
   concentrated onto the interneurons <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIZL;class=Cell">AIZL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIZR;class=Cell">AIZR</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAL;class=Cell">AIAL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAR;class=Cell">AIAR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBL;class=Cell">AIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBR;class=Cell">AIBR</a>. <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIZL;class=Cell">AIZL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIZR;class=Cell">AIZR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBL;class=Cell">AIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBR;class=Cell">AIBR</a>

   seen here resemble those seen in central pattern generators
   (oscillation generators) in other invertebrate systems (for several
   examples see Model neural networks and behaviour, ed Selverston,
   1985).  In these other systems reciprocal connections between
   neurons also appear to play an important part, and it is often seen
   that neurons are multifunctional, for instance with both motor
   neurons (Miller and Selverston, 1985) or command interneurons
   (Getting and Dekin, 1985) taking part in the pattern generating

   the motor control circuitry (<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIBL;class=Cell">RIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIBR;class=Cell">RIBR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIML;class=Cell">RIML</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIMR;class=Cell">RIMR</a>).  Much of the amphid
   receptor circuitry shown at the top of figure 8.2 is concentrated
   onto <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAL;class=Cell">AIAL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAR;class=Cell">AIAR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBL;class=Cell">AIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBR;class=Cell">AIBR</a>. It appears that one of these two neurons may be
   involved in feedback within the amphid circuitry, possibly to
   "tune" its output, while the other is involved in feedback that may
   determine the relative importance of the amphid output to the
   movement of the animal.  Another suggestion to explain the
   organisation of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAL;class=Cell">AIAL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAR;class=Cell">AIAR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBL;class=Cell">AIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBR;class=Cell">AIBR</a>, made initially by J G White, is that
   they receive joint input and that <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAL;class=Cell">AIAL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAR;class=Cell">AIAR</a> inhibits <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBL;class=Cell">AIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBR;class=Cell">AIBR</a>, thus causing
   the combination to act as a differentiating circuit which could be
   used to detect gradients during side to side head movement.  <br><br>
   The principle of a highly directed network containing small
   processing modules provides for only a very limited use of circuit
   feedback.  This use is to improve the versatility of small scale
   processing units made out of a very few neurons.  One reason that
   <i>C. elegans</i>  does not have longer loop neural feedback may be that,
   having only a shallow overall processing depth, it uses sensory
   feedback to perform this role.  The advantage of this is that it
   measures the actual, rather than the intended, outcome of motor
   activity.  Indeed it is thought that proprioceptive feedback may be
   important in the propagation of locomotory waves down the body. 
   However, even if more complicated nervous systems do have more
   sophisticated circuit structures, it may still be useful to
   effectively isolate functional units as much as possible from the
   internal working of other parts of the nervous system, even if
   those working are somewhat relevant.  If this is done then
   additional operations can be added easily at any stage without
   perturbing the rest of the system.  </p>
