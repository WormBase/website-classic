   Ring</H2>
   
   <p class=boxed>
   In order for nerve cells to make connections with each other they must be 
   in physical contact.  Therefore the physical arrangement of the neuropil is 
   an important part of its design. The <i>C. elegans</i>  nerve ring is 
   essentially a large parallel bundle of fibres bent around the pharynx.  A 
   typical transverse section through the <i>C. elegans</i>  nerve ring shows 
   an apparently homogeneous group of process outlines on each side.  
   Bilaterally symmetric processes occupy approximately symmetrical positions 
   within the bundle, but there is local disorder on the scale of a few 
   process diameters so that in general it is impossible to identify processes 
   on the basis of their positions, even over fairly long stretches of 
   reconstruction (although characteristic diagnostic properties of certain 
   neurons do make them identifiable).  <br>
   <br>
   It is presumably unnecessary to specify the exact relative positions of all 
   the processes, but important for there to be reasonably tight control over 
   process position because processes do not branch, so the only way to make 
   contact is to lie next to each other in the bundle.  How is position 
   controlled?  There are essentially two different possible sources of order, 
   either from contact with other processes or from an external source of 
   information, such as a gradient (e.g. Bonhoeffer and Huf, 1982).  The most 
   likely form of contact mediated information would be a mutual adhesivity 
   that kept two or more neurons together and therefore simplified the task of 
   specifying their positions.  Such selective fasciculation has been proposed 
   as important in laying down other invertebrate nervous systems during 
   development (see chapter 1 for review) and there are indications that it is 
   important in process outgrowth in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a class=cell

   The distribution of adjacency in the database.  The crosses connected by 
   the heavy line indicate the number of cell pairs in the database with a 
   particular adjacency.  The fine lines are the corresponding numbers from 
   the outcome of the random mixing stochastic model, using three different 
   values of the parameter, p, and averaged over 10 runs to get smooth 
   results.  The best overall fit to the distribution is given by p - 0.08.  
   This leaves two regions of misfit, X and Y, which are discussed in the 
   text.  Note that the vertical axis in this graph is nonlinear.

   An expansion of the region Y with three separate simulations of the random 
   mixing model with p = 0.08.  The gap between the true data and the model 
   data is clearly significant.  Since the vertical scale is linear in this 
   case the area of region Y corresponds to the number of "extra" high 
   adjacency contacts.  This predicts around 400 extra persistent contacts, or 
   2.3 per neuron (178 neurons).

   <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc9.1"> 9.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific persistent 
   contacts</H3>
   
   <p class=boxed>
   If selective fasciculation were important in organising the nerve ring, and 
   the adhesive forces remained after early development, then one would expect 
   to find pairs of processes with persistent contacts.  These should be 
   detectable in the database as pairs of neurons with exceptionally high 
   adjacencies.  If one looks at the distribution of all the adjacencies in 
   the database it would be the sum of two components, a random mixing 
   component, and a high adjacency component due to persistent contacts.  The 
   distribution of adjacencies is shown in figure 9.1.  There is a clear 
   change in slope at the curve at an adjacency of around 30.  <br>
   <br>
   In order to assess the significance of this shoulder, and to estimate its 
   size, and hence the average number of persistent contacts made by a neuron, 
   I produced a stochastic model of a collection of randomly mixing parallel 
   fibres.  This operates by recording the positions of the fibres in a 
   hexagonal grid representing a slice through the process tract, and then 
   moving to the next slice and allowing neighbouring processes to exchange 
   positions with a certain probability.  The adjacency of a pair of fibres is 
   then taken to be the number of slices in which they are neighbours.  The 
   total number of slices was taken to be 75 to make the total adjacency (sum 
   of all its adjacencies) of each fibre the same as the average total 
   adjacency for the processes in the database.  The second parameter, the 
   probability of a process switching, p, was chosen so as to best match the 
   model's distribution of adjacencies to that of the database.  Thje best fit 
   is given by p = 0.08.  <br>
   <br>
   There are two regions of misfit that cannot be eliminated, denoted by X and 
   Y. Region X is due to a very large number of additional contacts of very 
   short duration, which probably arise from processes crossing at an angle in 
   the nerve ring.  Such events are known to occur in the nerve ring but are 
   not considered by the computer model.  Region Y is the shoulder that 
   includes longer contacts than predicted by the random model.  Figure 9.2 
   shows an expansion of the shoulder region of the database distribution 
   together with data from 3 simulations of the model.  The shoulder is 
   clearly significant beyond the variation in the simulations due to 
   randomness in the model.  However it is fit quite well by the random model 
   with a low switching probability (p= 0.025, figure 9.1), which is not 
   surprising, because low switching probabilities for a subset of process 
   pairs are an approximation to specific adhesion between the processes, 
   which is the sort of feature that we predicted might give rise to a 
   shoulder beforehand.  <br>
   <br>
   It is possible to estimate the number of significantly persistent contacts 
   from the graph in figure 9.2 as about 400, and thus to arrive at a figure 
   of on average 2.3 persistent specific contacts per neuron.  This is very 
   crude - there may be many specific contacts of shorter length - but it 
   gives an indication that there may be fascicles or bundles of mutually 
   adhesive processes in the <i>C. elegans</i>  nerve ring.  However if such 
   bundles are common then they cannot contain very many processes, because 
   the average number for long bundles must be only 3 or 4.  A second test 
   suggests the same result.  The average number of contacts made by a neuron 
   is 52.1, most of which are short.  If we compare the adjacencies of all the 
   contacts with that of the longest contact then we see that on average 12.6 
   are longer then 25% of the maximum, only 4.8 are longer than 50% of the 
   maximum, but 2.4 are longer than 75% of the maximum.  Thus it seems that a 
   very small number of contacts are comparatively consistent.

    Clusters of neuronal classes obtained by hierarchical clustering of the 
    adjacency data.  There are three thicknesses of line, corresponding to an 
    association measure of 25 or more for the thickest, 15 or more for the 
    intermediate one, and 8 or more for the thinnest one.  All these clusters 
    were seen on both sides of the nervous system.  In some cases the dorsal 
    and ventral members of the same class ended up reproducibly in different 
    clusters (e.g. <a class=cell

    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">SMB</a>).  The positions of 
    classes were moved as little as possible from those in figure 8.1, in order 
    to show the relationship between possible bundle assignments and circuitry.

    <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc9.2"> 9.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Identified bundles</H3>
    
    <p class=boxed>
    It is hard to tell with individual process pairs whether their high 
    adjacency in accidental or not, but if several processes combined in a 
    bundle it should be objectively deducible from the adjacency information in 
    the database.  A bundle will consist of a group of processes with the 
    property that all pairs in the group are highly adjacent, but no other 
    process is very adjacent to the group as a whole.  <br>
    <br>
    The number of possible groups goes up exponentially with the size of the 
    group, so it is not possible to try every one even with small groups.  
    However there is a branch of multivariate statistics called cluster 
    analysis that is specifically designed to handle this type of problem, and 
    a variant of a standard algorithm from this theory was used to extract 
    clusters of highly mutually adjacent processes that are likely candidates 
    for bundles.  The details of this algorithm are given in the appendix, but 
    the final result is a hierarchial set of nested clusters with a measure of 
    the degree of association at each level, which corresponds to an average 
    internal adjacency.  Any real clusters, such as the proposed bundles, 
    should stand out as having a high association measure at the level of the 
    group, but not combine well with an external process or group at the next 
    level down.  Figure 9.3 shows the bundles detected by the algorithm in the 
    <i>C. elegans</i>  database at associations measure cutoffs of 25, 15 and 
    8.  In the case of contralateral homologues, either bundles were seen on 
    both sides, or the same bundle included both homologues.  <br>
    <br>
    In order to provide an objective significance criterion for the association 
    measure of a cluster, I used the same algorithm on data from a simulation 
    of the random mixing model described in the last section (with p = 0.08).  
    The maximum association measure obtained was 12.75 and less than 10% of the 
    values were greater than 7.5.  Thus according to this criterion all the 
    bundles shown in figure 9.3 at an associational level of 15 are likely to 
    be significant, as are most of those at a level of 8, especially when they 
    occur on both sides of the animal.  <br>
    <br>
    Since the clustering method is hierarchial and continues to make larger and 
    larger clusters it does generate further amalgamations of the bundles seen 
    in figure 9.3.  Although the association measure for such bundles falls 
    below our significance test level there is evidence that some of them are 
    real, primarily because the same groupings are seen for homologous bundles 
    on the two different sides of the same animal.  The fact that they have a 
    low association measure implies that they are not true completely mixing 
    bundles, but they may be either super-bundles - bundles of bundles - or 
    cases where processes are shared by several bundles. The suggestion that 
    particular processes might belong to more than one bundle is taken further 
    in the discussion section.

9.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion</H3>
   <p class=boxed>There is some evidence in the database for the presence of
   reproducible persistent contacts between nerve fibres, both between
   pairs of neurons and between groups of three or more processes that
   run together round the ring as sub-bundles within the complete
   process tract.  The largest grouping of neurons which all had
   fairly high adjacency to each other contained seven cell types
   (figure 9.3) but most of the likely bundles generated by cluster
   analysis of the neighbourhood information contained only two or
   three cell types.  The average number of high adjacency contacts
   per neuron was also small (2.3).  <br><br>The analysis presented
   here suffers from its reliance on identifying specific contacts by
   unusually high adjacencies.  It would therefore miss any important
   short term contacts, and would also be confused by processes that
   for half their length are in one part of the neuropil, and for the
   other half in another part.  There is a clear example of such
   behaviour in the case of the interneuron <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBL;class=Cell">AIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBR;class=Cell">AIBR</a>, which runs near <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAL;class=Cell">AIAL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIAR;class=Cell">AIAR</a>
   in the proximal part of its trajectory, and near <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIBL;class=Cell">RIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIBR;class=Cell">RIBR</a> in the distal
   part (White, 1983).  This is consistent with <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBL;class=Cell">AIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBR;class=Cell">AIBR</a>'s role as the
   major linking interneuron between the amphid receptor circuitry and
   the motor control circuitry (figure 8.2).  Such switching of
   bundles could be used by other processes that carry information
   between sufficiently different groups of processes.  <br><br>Another
   example of the possible presence of sub-bundles in the nervous
   system is provided by the motor neuron processes in the ventral
   nerve cord.  The <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VA</a> and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VB</a> classes of motor neuron are both
   bipolar, with an axonal process that produces neuromuscular output
   for part of its length (the other part neither makes nor receives
   connections) and also receives some input, and a dendritic process
   that is purely postsynaptic.  All the dendrites run together in one
   place, under the main motor neurons, while all the axons run in a
   group against the basement membrane.  Although these two groups of
   processes are adjacent they rarely mix.  In addition there are a
   number of places where a motor neuron commissure cuts across the
   entire nerve cord; when this happened the commissure usually runs
   between the dendritic and axonal groups, separating one group from
   the other, but splitting neither (7/13 cases; in 5/13 a <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VB</a> dendrite
   is on the wrong side - in only one case is the axonal bundle
   split).  In this case a general adhesion between like processes may
   be useful in keeping all the dendrites near their source of
   inervation, and keeping the axons near the basement membrane, where
   neuromuscular junctions are made.  <br><br>There is a strong
   relationship between the proposed groupings of the neurons into
   bundles and the circuitry.  Figure 9.3 has been organised so as to
   show the extent to which the bundles are formed from neurons that
   are near in the processing diagram in figure 8.1, which was
   obtained purely from connectivity data.  However it is by no means
   true that all persistent pairwise contacts are between neurons that
   are connected, either by chemical synapses, or by gap junctions
   (e.g. <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">CEP</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">URX</a>, or the ventral cord motor neuron bundles).  In
   some cases bundles correspond to parts of the processing modules
   defined previously on the basis of internal feedback, but they also
   often contain vertical groupings of neuronal classes from the
   directional ordering, sometimes with elements from two modules, one
   of which feeds into the other.  Such organisation is to be expected
   if the main criterion for process placement is to maximise the
   adjacency of symaptic partners, since the main flow of information
   is down through the network, across the modules.  <br><br>The
   observation that there are a small number of persistent contacts
   suggests that specific fasciculation mechanisms are significant in
   the <i>C. elegans</i>  nerve ring, and appears to rule out the
   specification of process position by a general mechanism that acts
   equivalently on all cells.  This is perhaps not surprising in an
   organism with such a small number of cells, almost all of which are
   distinct, forming different sets of specific connections.  The data
   certainly do not allow the prediction of a set of hierarchical
   forces that could determine position in the nerve ring.  There is
   also the problem present in all the analysis of the database of
   trying to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in
   building a structure (the nerve ring) by looking at the finished
   product.  However, taken together with the evidence for the role of
   specific fasciculation in embryonic neural outgrowth presented in
   the first part of this thesis, there are strong grounds for
   believing that the organisation of the nerve ring may make use of
   small specific bundles to correctly position processes so that
   synaptic connections can be made.  </p>
