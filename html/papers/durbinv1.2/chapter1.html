1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</H2>
   <p class=boxed>The first part of this dissertation describes an investigation
   into the outgrowth of nerve processes in the region of the ventral
   nerve cord of <i>C. elegans</i> during embryonic development.  The course of
   normal development was deduced from serial section reconstructions
   of a set of embryos fixed at different stages.  Then laser ablation
   experiments were performed to remove specific neurons whose
   processes grew out during these early stages, in order to test
   whether the presence of these processes was necessary for correct
   subsequent development of the nervous system.  Chapter 2 gives
   materials and methods.  The observations from the wild type
   reconstructions are given in Chapter 3 and the results of the
   ablation experiments are described in Chapter 4.  The two sets of
   results are discussed together in Chapter 5.  There are no previous
   direct results on the course of neural outgrowth in <i>C. elegans</i>, although
   disruption of the final arrangement of nerve processes has been
   observed in mutants (Hedgecock <i>et al.</i>, 1985) and animals in which
   laser damage has prevented nerve cell migration (Chalfie <i>et al.</i>,
   1983).  Below I first review previous work in other systems on
   neural guidance, and then give an introduction to <i>C. elegans</i> and its
   nervous system.  </p>

1.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of neural guidance</H3>
   <p class=boxed>The building of a nervous system during development can be
   divided into three phases: the generation of the correct cells in
   the correct places, the outgrowth of nerve processes, and the
   formation of synapses.  All of these phases show a high degree of
   specificity, which means that a large amount of information must be
   expressed by mechanisms that on the whole we do not yet understand,
   but would like to.  In some ways the second phase, that of process
   outgrowth is the most clearly defined.  This is because all neural
   branching structures are a consequence of a single phenomenon, the
   migration of growth cones during development, a truth which Cajal
   saw early and fought hard for (Hamburger, 1981), and which led
   Harrison to develop the first tissue culture techniques in order to
   follow outgrowing neurites directly (Harrison, 1910).<br><br>A growth
   cone is a specialised structure at the tip of any growing neurite
   that migrates through the animal, spinning out the nerve process
   behind it.  This is not the only means by which nerve processes can
   be lengthened, since change in size and shape of the animal is
   matched by addition of new material to already existing processes. 
   In many cases most of the length of nerve fibres is created in this
   way, but it is almost entirely passive, having at most a very small
   effect on the layout of the neurons axonal structure.  For
   instance, most nerve processes grow along the ventral cord of <i>C. elegans</i>
   when it is only around 100 microns long, a tenth of its final
   length.  However some changes in overall structure do occur by
   intercalary insertion; an example is the conversion of an initially
   bipolar cell to one that is pseudo-monopolar, by retraction of the
   cell body away from the branch (Kuwada, 1986 and with ventral nerve
   cord motor neurons in <i>C. elegans</i>).  Such small alterations during
   subsequent development emphasise the importance of looking at
   outgrowth as it takes place, rather than making inferences from the
   finished pattern.</p>

          <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc1.1.1">
1.1.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth cones <em>in vitro</em></H4>
   <p class=boxed>Growth cones are generally spread out, lamellar
   structures, which often extend fine microspikes, or filopodia
   (Letourneau, 1983).  They mover over surfaces and as they move
   thevarious lamellar and filopodial extensions are retracted and new
   ones are extended out, so that the overall shape is continually
   changing (Bray and Chapman, 1985).  It is easy to study growth cone
   migration in vitro using cultured neurons and a wide range of
   factors that affect migration have been observed.  In order for
   motion to take place it appears that fairly tight adhesion to the
   substrate is necessary (Bray, 1979), and this leads immediately to
   the idea that differential adhesion may be important for growth
   cone guidance.  Letourneau (1980) has shown that growth cones do
   indeed tend to grow along regions of higher adversity when faced
   with a choice in vitro.  Although this may support the common
   suggestion that growth cones may in many cases be guided up an
   adhesive gradient in vivo (Nardi, 1983, Berlot and Goodman, 1984),
   it does not directly address that proposal, and there are several
   severe problems with the idea.  Growth cones show different
   morphologies when migrating on artificial surfaces of different
   adhesivities, but even though the range of morphologies seen on
   different neurites in vivo is vast, any one growth cone does not
   change shape as it migrates over a uniform surface.  In addition
   the strength of adhesivity would have to increase exponentially,
   which would require an excessive magnitude range of adhesivity for
   a gradient of any substantial length.  In fact growth cones in
   culture tend to grow in straight lines anyway, only changing
   directions when they branch.  Based n an elegant combination of
   observations and experiments Bray has suggested that the neurite
   leaving the back of the growth cone exerts a tension, and that the
   growth cone always grows away from the source of tension (Bray,
   1979).  If the angle of the neurite is altered then the direction
   of growth coordinately changes, and if the tension is relaxed, by
   for example cutting the neurite, then the growth cones divides in
   two, the two halves growing off in opposite directions and exerting
   tension against each other.  Together these results suggest that
   direction changes and branches may occur in vivo either where a
   path of higher adversity is crossed, or possibly at a point where
   the growth cone becomes tethered, so that growth in the new
   direction can pull against something.<br><br>Although there is a
   strong tendency to think of attractive forces on growth cones as
   being the principle tools of guidance control, it is equally
   possible for repulsive forces to be influential, and there are
   several examples that are known.  There is a highly selective
   inhibitory effect when the neurotransmitter 5-HT is released from a
   micropipette near the advancing growth cone of an identified cell
   from the mollusc, Helisoma (Haydon <i>et al.</i>, 1984).  This has been
   proposed to have developmental significance in the detailed
   development of the Helisoma buccal ganglion (meinertxhagen, 1985). 
   A retraction of the growth cone in vitro is also seen when rtinal
   and sympathetic axons meet each other in culture (Bray <i>et al.</i>,
   1980, Kampfhammer <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  Although retinal growth cones
   will cross retinal axons, and sympathetic growth cones will cross
   sympathetic axons, when one meets the other it shrinks back and
   withdraws its filopodial and lamellar extensions.  Similar
   avoidance behaviour between different neurites of the same neuron
   could possibly explain the marvellous space filling,
   non-overlapping properties of many neurons' dendritic or axonal
   arborisations.  Experimental evidence for such avoidance has been
   provided by studies of single sensory neurons in the leech, which
   fill a planar surface from several points in an apparently
   self-competitive fashion (Kramer and Stent, 1985).  As yet there is
   no experimental evidence of such mechanisms acting between
   different neurons in vivo, but there are several cases in C.
   elegans where neurons abut against but do not overlap other members
   of their own classes; often there is a gap junction between the two
   abutting processes (see Chaper 7).</p>
   
       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc1.1.2">
1.1.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies <i>in vivo</i></H4>
   <p class=boxed>It is convenient to make a distinction between directional,
   tropic influences on neural guidance and spatially restricted,
   contact mediated influences.  Both appear to play an important
   part.  To oversimplify the situation, tropic influences are
   directionally constraining, while differential adhesivities are
   spatially constraining.  There is also a division between specific
   and nonspecific factors.  By nonspecific factors I mean those that
   would influence any of a large range of different neurons.  Neither
   of these divisions is totally sharp, and in particular specificity
   is clearly a graded phenomenon.  <br><br>The classical example of a
   non-specific factor would be a gradient of positional information
   (Wolpert, 1971), probably some chemical or surface marker, and the
   classical experimental system where there is evidence for such a
   gradient in neural development is in the establishment of a
   topographical mapping from the retina onto the optic tectum of
   lower vertebrates.  A series of experiments in which an ordered
   mapping reformed after parts of the retina and/or tectum were
   removed or grafted back in abnormal orientations suggested that the
   original chemo-affinity hypothesis of Sperry (1963), which proposed
   specific matching between corresponding sectors of the retina and
   tectum, was incorrect (see Gaze, 1970).  More recently Bonhoeffer
   and Huf (1982) have shown using an in vitro axon growth choice
   assay that there is a gradient of affinity for temporal axons
   across the surface of the tectum, with highest affinity for the
   rostral part of the tectum, which is their normal target. 
   Progressively more nasal axons show less specificity.  The overall
   effect of these affinities would then be established by
   competition.  There are many other proposed sources of information
   for the retino-tectal system, some also driven by competition (e.g.
   Willshaw and von der Malsburg, 1979).  <br><br>However the situation
   during creation of the retino-tectal map on the surface of the
   tectum is different from the early outgrowth of processes that
   concerns the study of embryonic <i>C. elegans</i>  outgrowth in this
   dissertation, since the axons have already reached their target
   tissue and are finding the correct place on it amongst a group of
   equivalent cells.  For the rest of this review I will focus on the
   pathfinding properties of growth cones necessary to find their
   targets from the cell bodies, rather than the final stage as
   discussed here.  </p>
   
       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc1.1.3">
1.1.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Directional and tropic effects</H4>
   <p class=boxed>A very different function of a gradient is to specify a
   direction up which axons can travel.  There are several examples
   where a general attraction that is not path specific has been
   indicated experimentally.  Harris (1980) has shown this type of
   effect using the same retino-tectal projection in Xenopus menioned
   above as an experimental system, but at the earlier stage of
   development where the optic tract must be formed.  Before axon
   outgrowth he implanted whole eye primordia into abnormal places in
   the brain, after which in most cases the retinal axons grew out and
   took a nearly direct route to the tectum, usually via a pathway
   totally different to the one they normally follow.  If the implant
   was sufficiently caudal then the retinal processes ran instead down
   the spinal cord, in a particular dorsolateral tract, reproducing
   previous observations that this part of the spinal cord attracted
   displaced retinal axons (Constantine-Paton and Capranica, 1976). 
   These results suggest that there is a general attraction of retinal
   axons to their target, and that this acts over a fairly wide zone,
   but that the mechanism may not be uniquely used for retino-tectal
   pathfinding; in the spinal cord, outside the normal range of
   retinal axons the same attraction system may be used for another
   set of processes.  <br><br>A more specific attraction of neurons to
   their targets has been observed in the vertebrate peripheral
   nervous system (PNS).  Lance-Jones and Landmesser (1981) showed
   that after a short piece of chick neural tube was reversed the
   motor neurons till largely found a way to the correct target
   muscles, crossing over each other on the way.  However if the
   displacement is too great then they often grow to inappropriate
   muscles (ibid.  and Summerbell and Stirling, 1981).  Again this
   influence appears to be over a longer range than the reach of the
   filopodia, though still reasonably localised (Landmesser, 1984). 
   There are also indications in the insect PNS that after the more
   specific cues are removed there is still a tendency for sensory
   neurons to grow proximally towards the central nervous system
   (CNS), even along abnormal routes (Berlot and Goodman, 1984, Nardi,
   1983).  <br><br>One suggestion of a possible agent involved in the
   general attraction of a whole class of nerve fibres is nerve growth
   factor (NGF).  Sympathetic fibres grow over abnormal territory
   towards a site of NGF injection in vivo (Gunderson and Barrett,
   1980).  However in both cases the amounts applied are much larger
   than the ovserved natural levels; NGF is much better known as a
   trophic agent necessary for neuron survival and a general promoter
   of neuron outgrowth, and the directional effect may be a subsidiary
   non-physiological consequence of an overdose of these other
   behaviours.  In a careful set of experiments with explants from
   embryonic mouse trigeminal ganglia and their target tissue,
   maxiliary epithelium, Lumsden and Davies (1983, 1986) have shown a
   clear directional tropic attraction of trigeminal fibres to their
   target.  This is diffusible through the colagen matrix in which the
   explants sit and the axons grow, and is separable from NGF, which
   appears to act later in development to preserve the connection.  It
   also has no effect on axons from comparable neighbouring ganglia. 
   Lumsden and Davies argue that NGF is active on too many cell types
   to be sensible as a tropic agent.  However it might be countered
   that a general tendency for sympathetic axons to grow towards the
   periphery could be useful.  <br><br>All these results suggest that
   there may be general directional (often homing) guidance mechanisms
   that are not restricted to specific pathways, and apply to fairly
   broad classes of neurons.  Interestingly the range of all the
   attractions is approximately the same, of the order of a few
   hundred microns.  In cases that are more specific, such as the
   chick motor neuron guidance, the absolute size of the embryo is
   larger.  Such distances correspond to a fairly small number of
   growth cone extensions, suggesting that a growth cone could detect
   a gradient on this scale.  Since some specificity is involved and
   the directions of different sets of fibres can cross (as in the
   chick limb motor neuron experiments), it seems unlikely that a
   single gradient, such as a general adhesive gradient, provides the
   best explanation for them.  In at least one case (Lumsden and
   Davies) the substrate if artificial and the factor is diffusible. 
   <br><br>Before automatically explaining any experiment indicating a
   directional effect by a gradient, it should be born in mind,
   however, that there are at least two other ways in which a polarity
   or directionality could be specified.  The first is intrinsic to
   the neuron, simply by the orientation in which it was created by
   its final cell division.  This may often be important for
   initiating process outgrowth in the correct direction (Jan <i>et al.</i>,
   1985).  The second is by a repeated sequence of more than two
   signals, in which case the direction can be determined by
   inspecting neighbouring sequence elements, or equivalently by a
   moving wave of some signal.  This type of signal can operate over
   very long distances if it is actively maintained, and is the method
   is slime mould aggregation (Gerisch, 1982).  </p>
   
       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc1.1.4">
1.1.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fasciculation of nerve processes</H4>
   <p class=boxed>A different sort of nonspecific influence that is important
   for neuronal outgrowth is the strong tendency of growth cones to
   grow along other neurons, which leads to the fasciculation of nerve
   processes.  This is clearly one of the most important factors
   determining the structure of the peripheral nervous system, which
   is made of nerve bundles, and where closely studied it has also
   been seen to be important in the early developing central nervous
   system at stages where processes are not dense (e.g. the insect
   CNS, Bate and Grunewald, 1981, Goodman <i>et al.</i>, 1982).  This has
   been seen by immunofluorescence to be expressed on many neuronal
   cell surfaces, and also on various epithelial and glial cells
   (Silver and Rutishauser, 1984).  It has been claimed that the
   modulation of a single molecule such as NCAM could account for a
   very large proportion of the control of neural outgrowth (Edelman,
   1983), but this appears unlikely because of the degree of
   specificity seen in many different but often adjacent and
   simultaneous interactions.  However there is a large part to be
   played by fairly non-specific adhesion.  <br><br>Almost a direct
   consequence of general neuronal fasciculation is the concept of the
   preservation of order within nerve bundles by a process tending to
   stay stuck to its neighbours.  Many nerve projections show a
   general topographic order preservation, both in the central and
   peripheral nervous system (e.g. the retinal-tectal and spinal cord
   projections) and a simple method of correct guidance may be to
   place neurons in positions corresponding to a topological map of
   their targets and then to preserve the relative spatial arrangement
   in the outgoing bundle of fibres and rely on non-specific cues to
   spread the projection onto the target tissue(s).  In fish
   retino-tectal projections Scholes (1979) has shown that order is in
   general maintained, but that there is a zone of active
   reorganisation near the tectum, and in other cases where ordering
   has been observed an active mechanism for correcting the final
   projection has also been detected (e.g. Landmesser, 1984).  </p>
   
       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc1.1.5">
1.1.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pioneers and specific fasciculation</H4>
   <p class=boxed>The observation that fasciculation is a significant factor
   led to a realisation of the importance of the first nerve pioneers
   to grow out, called "pioneers" by Harrison (1910) and to the
   suggestion that they may be specialised in order to be able to lay
   down new paths.  The pioneers in a various part of different insect
   peripheral nervous systems have been studied first by Bate (1976a),
   and subsequently by many others (e.g. Ho and Goodman, 1982, Bentley
   and Keshishian, 1982, Blari and Palka, 1985, Jan <i>et al.</i>  1985). 
   Although in certain cases outgrowing central neurons grow out over
   new territory (Ho and Goodman, 1982), the majority of nerve bundles
   are pioneered by peripheral sensory neurons that essentially always
   follow a series of other neuronal cell bodies spaced out at
   intervals on the way to the CNS. This observation led to the
   "guidepost" hypothesis, that there are a class of specified cells
   in the periphery that are guideposts (maybe all neurons) and that
   pioneer growth cones search for and grow towards the nearest
   guidepost cell within reach at each stage (Bentley and Keshishian,
   1982).  In this case it appears that no single pioneer is
   essential, since various cell removal experiments resulted in
   satisfactory correction or adaptation (Keshishian and Bentley),
   1983, Blair and Palka, 1985).  <br><br>Ho and Goodman (1982) argue
   for a certain degree of specificity of fasciculation in the
   grasshopper PNS, particularly for outward growing CNS axons which
   must choose branches at points where afferent fibres have
   converged.  There appears to be a much greater amount of
   specificity in the grasshopper CNS. Here again the earliest pioneer
   fibres have been identified (Bate and Grunewald, 1981), and the
   subsequent outgrowth of certain identified neurons has been
   followed (Goodman <i>et al.</i>, 1982).  A large number of closely
   adjacent fascicles are established and growth cones often cross a
   number of them before fasciculating with a particular one.  This
   has lead to the "labelled pathways" hypothesis (Ghysen and Jansen,
   1979, Goodman <i>et al.</i>, 1982), that the fascicles are differentially
   labelled by surface molecules and that growth cones are programmed
   to recognise a sequence of these labels and grow along them, thus
   defining a route through the developing nervous system.  Ablations
   of neurons that generate the pathways for identified cells in this
   system have resulted in the stalling of growth cones (Raper <i>et al.</i>,
   1984, Bastiani <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  This contrasts with what has been
   seen in the PNS, and provides a genuine example of a specialised
   pioneer, whose presence is necessary for later axons to follow. 
   <br><br>The chick PNS experiments described earlier provide another
   example of the requirement for a preexisting fascicle along which a
   subsequent neuron type will follow.  In the experiments in which
   sections of neural tube, or limb buds, are displaced, sensory
   neurons that innervate muscle only follow the correct pathways to
   their muscles if the corresponding motor neurons do so (Honig et
   al., 1986).  Furthermore, if instead of displacing motor neurons
   the whole motor neuron pool is removed before axon outgrowth, so
   that later there is no motor innervation of muscle, then there is
   effectively no sensory innervation of muscle either, and instead
   cutaneous sensory innervation is increased (Landmesser and Honig,
   1986).  <br><br>Therefore, in addition tot he nonspecific general
   tropism and fasciculation that were discussed earlier, there is
   substantial evidence for specific interactions between neurons and
   bundles of other neurons with which they will fasciculate.  In the
   case of the insect CNS the specificity appears to be almost
   certainly mediated by contact; not only are the differing choices
   too tightly packed for a longer range influence to be sufficiently
   selective, but there have also been seen in the electron microscope
   direct interactions of growth cone filopodia inserting themselves
   deep into the surfaces of cells they wille ventually fasciculate
   with (Bastiani and Goodman, 1984).  Monoclonal antibodies have
   recently been made that appear to recognise specific fascicles in
   the grasshopper CNS, and the growth cones that will join them
   (harrelson <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  Interestingly in each case several
   different bundles stain with the same antibody.  If the antigens
   are involved in determining fasciculation then this would be
   reminiscent of the observation with ectopic retinal implants that
   there seems to be an affinity of retinal axons for an abnormal
   target in the spinal cord, as well as the tectum.  </p>
   
       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc1.1.6">
1.1.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interactions with non-neuronal surfaces</H4>
   <p class=boxed>Up until now the interactions between growth cones and their
   targets, or other neurons, have been stressed, but clearly their
   relationship to non-neuronal substrates may also be important,
   particularly for pioneer neurons.  In various different situations
   growth cones have been proposed to migrate over basement membrane,
   glial cells, epithelial cells, and mesenchyme.  One of the strong
   reasons for proposing basement membrane as a possible neuronal
   substrate is that both raw basement membrane and several purified
   basement membrane components, such as fibronectin and laminin, have
   been shown to provide good surfaces for outgrowth in vitro
   (Varon-van Evercooren <i>et al.</i>, 1982).  Also in vitro processes are
   often found growing in spaces adjacent ot a limiting basement
   membrane (e.g. the CNS pioneers in the grasshopped, Bate and
   Grunewald, 1981, or the first fibres in the fish spinal cord,
   Kuwada <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  However this region almost always also
   contains a large number of glial processes, and at least in the
   case of retinal axons, the nerve fibres seem to be particularly
   strongly attached to these glial endfeet (Krayanek and Goldberg,
   1981), which have been shown to stain early on for NCAM (Silver and
   Rutishauser, 1984).  The ordered outgrowth of retinal axons can be
   disrupted by injection of anti-NCAM antibodies (ibid.).  In
   addition Silver and Ogawa (1981) have shown that a preformed glial
   bridge is ncessary and sufficient for growth of neocortial fibres
   across the corpus callosum.  <br><br>On the basis of this type of
   observation, Singer <i>et al.</i>  (1979) proposed the blueprint
   hypothesis, suggesting that there was a preformed meshwork of
   favoured pathways established on the glial and neuroepithelial
   external surface, which would channel growth cones in the same sort
   of way as Letourneau's adhesive grid in vitro (Letourneau, 1980). 
   As with fasciculation, to which this type of concept is clearly
   related, non-neuronal blueprints could come in a complete range of
   specificities, from generally available for all axons to completely
   specific for a particular growth cone.  In the case of the
   grasshopper CNS it has been possible to implicate a particular
   glial cell, the segment border cell, as determining the exit site
   for one of the main connectives to the periphery (Bastiani and
   Goodman, 1986).  It effectively acts as a specific labelled pathway
   itself.  </p>
   
       <H4><A NAME="tth_sEc1.1.7">
1.1.7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary</H4>
   <p class=boxed>There is no case where the underlying mechanisms that control
   a nontrivial outgrowth pattern for a particular neuron or type of
   neuron have been determined in detail.  One of the reasons for this
   is that we still know too little about the molecular and cellular
   basis of growth cone movement and guidance (Letourneau, 1983).  On
   a larger scale, there are a number of experiments suggesting
   various sources of influence for process outgrowth.  These
   experiments normally involve perturbation of particular factors in
   vivo and the results can sometimes be open to variable
   interpretation, depending on the hypotheses being addressed by the
   interpreter.  One certain conclusion, however, is that a large
   range of different mechanisms can be used to influence neural
   guidance, usually in various combinations, and often in a redundant
   fashion.  The information necessay for determining the outgrowth of
   any particular neuron will be expressed via a subset of these
   factors, the relevant subset probably differing in different stages
   of outgrowth.  <br><br>Therefore the best that can be done at the
   general level is to identify the basic forms of the different types
   of relevant influence and interaction, and provide a list of tools
   that are available to whatever program controls development.  In
   generating such a list I again restrict myself to outgrowth from
   the cell to the target, rather than interactions on the target
   tissue in which competition and neural activity may well play a
   part.  With this restriction there currently seems to be evidence
   for the following list:<br><br>
   1. Much of the necessary organisation can be achieved by the initial 
   positioning and orienting of the neurons.<br>
   2. There is a general tendency for axons to extend in straight lines unless 
   otherwise influenced.  <br>
   3. There can be local inhibitory influences on growth cone extension, 
   either humoral or contact mediated.  <br>
   4. Adhesion is clearly important for growth cone migration, and it seems 
   likely that preformed generally adhesive pathways provide a set of 
   preferred highways for processes to grow along.  <br>
   5. Also in the realm of general adhesivity, there is a strong tendency for 
   extending neurites to fasciculate together.  <br>
   6. Both these last two influences can also act in a specific, as well as a 
   non-specific, fashion, for example when a growth cone joins one particular 
   fascicle out of several.  <br>
   7. There can be a directional attraction of axons, normally from some 
   fairly broad class of neurons, to some target or region, and this can 
   function when a normal route is unavailable.  At least in some cases this 
   attraction is mediated by diffusible factors. <br>
   <br>


   For those elements of the list where there is specificity, as in
   the last two cases, it seems that the same specificity mechanism
   may be used in more than one place.  <br><br>Even if this list were
   complete, it would only provide a framework for two further lines
   of inquiry.  The first is to search for the molecular and cellular
   mechanisms involved in each type of interaction, and the nature of
   their possible diversity and specificity.  The second is to
   investigate how the consequent repertoire of available influences
   intricate outgrowth patterns for the huge variety of different
   neurons.  One way to attack these problems is to choose an organism
   where the types of interaction involved and the different levels of
   specificity can be made as clear as possible, and then use the
   experimental power of molecular genetics as a technique to probe
   both the nature of the molecules concerned and the internal control
   structure of the genome.  A good candidate for that organism is C.
   elegans.  <br><br>So far in this introduction I have mixed examples
   from invertebrate and vertebrate model systems fairly freely, since
   many of the results can be directly compared, and it seems likely
   that factors which control growth cone guidance at the cellular
   level may well be analogous, if not identical, between even very
   widely diverged species.  The significant difference between
   invertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems for the purposes of
   experimentation on axon guidance is that, in addition to in general
   containing orders of magnitude fewer cells than vertebrate ganglia,
   many and in some cases all, neurons in an invertebrate ganglion are
   reproducibly identifiable from one animal to the next.  Often there
   will be only one or a small reproducible number of cells with any
   particular set of characteristics.  Therefore repeatable
   experiments can be undertaken concerning a known individual neuron
   and the specific factors involved in controlling the outgrowth of
   its processes.  <i>C. elegans</i>  contains only 302 neurons altogether,
   all of which are identifiable, and for all of which the complete
   audit anatomy is known at the electron microscope level (White et
   al., 1986).  <br><br>Finally, but not least importantly, we turn to
   the use of genetic techniques to study neural outgrowth.  The
   primary reason for choosing <i>C. elegans</i>  as a model organism for the
   study of neural development was not the simplicity of its nervous
   system, but that it is well suited to genetic analysis (Brenner,
   1974).  The reason that genetics has not been mentioned before this
   point is that, although it can provide an extremely powerful tool
   for studying biological function and control and has been
   extensively used to study neuronal cell determination (e.g. Lehmann
   <i>et al.</i>, 1983, Hedgecock, 1985), it has as yet provided very little
   insight into neural guidance.  In vertebrates a few known mutations
   affect neuronal branching patterns and guidance, such as mouse
   mutants weaver, staggerer and reeler, which affect the structure of
   various cell types in the cerebellum (Caviness and Rakic, 1978). 
   In Drosophila there are several mutations that have been used as
   experimental tools to remove neurons, or produce them in abnormal
   places (e.g. the homeotic mutants, Palka, 1982) but the only
   published mutation that seems to directly affect neuronal guidance
   is bendless, in which one of the neuron types involved in the
   escape jump response fails to reach its target (Thomas and Wyman,
   1982).  However it is not known whether other processes are
   affected, nor is the wild type development of the particular neuron
   known.  In fact the organism in which the greatest number of neural
   guidance specific mutants are known is <i>C. elegans</i>  (Hedgecock et
   al., 1985, S. McIntire, J. White, E. Hedgecock, personal
   communications, discussed further in the next section).  In
   addition to any intrinsic interest and possible significance, it
   was in order to provide the developmental framework for further
   characterisation of the molecular mechanisms involved in guidance
   via this genetic approach that the study described in this thesis
   was undertaken.</p>

1.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system</H3>
   <p class=boxed><i>C. elegans</i>  is a small nematode, or roundworm, approximately
   1mm long in the adult form.  It has a simple body structure and a
   small number of cells: 959 somatic cells including 302 neuons. 
   Development from egg to fertile adult takes only three and a half
   days at room temperature.  Wild type animals used in this study are
   isogenic, since the egglaying sex is a self-fertilising
   hermaphrodite, rather than a female, with the consequence that
   strains are normally propogated asexually, forming clones.  Males
   occur naturally at low frequencies.  Ther hermaphroditism also
   facilitates genetic analysis, and many mutants have been studied. 
   Together these facts make <i>C. elegans</i>  a favourable model organism
   for the detailed study of development at the level of single cells,
   using both anatomical and genetic techniques, and it was chosen as
   such by Sydney Brenner (1974).  <br><br>The life cycle consists of
   an embryonic stage, inside the egg, which takes about 16 hours,
   followed by four larval stages, named L1 to L4.  The course of
   development is extremely reproducible.  The pattern of cell
   divisions from the fertilised egg to the adult has been determined
   completely (Sulston and Horvitz, 1979, Kimbe and Hirsh, 1979,
   Sulston <i>et al.</i>, 1983) and is essentially invariant.  <br><br>Not
   only are the pattern of cell division and the general body plan of
   <i>C. elegans</i>  simple and reproducible at a cellular level, but so is
   its nervous system.  The complete nervous system of the adult
   hermaphrodite has been reconstructed by White <i>et al.</i>  (1986) from
   electron micrographs of serial thin sections.  The neurons have
   simple branching structures, and both the dispositions of cell
   processes, and the connections they make, appear to be largely
   invariant between animals.  They can be assigned to 118 different
   neuronal classes on the basis of morphology and synaptic
   connectivity (the system of nomenclature is described in Chapter
   2).  An overview of the nervous system of an L1 larva is shown in
   Figure 1.2.  Its central processing region is a loop of neuropil
   around the pharynx, called the nerve ring, containing around 175
   nerve processes.  Running from this is a set of longitudinal
   process bundles that connect the ring to sensory receptors, the
   body motor nervous system, and several small ganglia in the tail. 
   There are also circumferential commissures carrying processes from
   one lonitudinal bundle to another.  The most important of the
   longitudinal bundles is the ventral nerve cord, which runs from the
   retrovesicular ganglion (RVG) just behind the nerve ring to the
   preanal ganglion (PAG) at the beginning of the tail, and containing
   the motor neuron cell bodies for the body motor circuitry.  <br><br>
   Nerve cells in <i>C. elegans</i>  are small (less than 5 microns in
   diameter) and it is not currently practical to impale them with
   microelectrodes.  However intracellular recording from selected
   neurons has been possible in the larger nematode, Ascaris
   lumbricoides.  Attention has been focussed on the ventral cord
   motor circuitry (reviewed in Stretton <i>et al.</i>, 1985), and the
   distribution of cell types seen there corresponds anatomically very
   closely to that in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

   Previous studies on neural process guidance in <i>C. elegans</i> have been 
   restricted to examining the structure of the adult nervous system in both 
   wild type animals and mutants in which processes go astray.  White (1983) 
   discusses some possible factors that may be important in neural guidance on 
   the basis of the adult electron microscope reconstructions.  Chapter 9 of 
   this thesis also considers process placement in the nerve ring using data 
   from the adult reconstructions.  Several techniques (mostly unpublished) 
   have been developed to visualise processes by light microscopy, and these 
   have been used to screen mutants that have possible neural defects, such as 
   uncoordinated mutants that do not move well. Hedgecock <i>et al.</i> (1985) 
   filled certain classes of sensory neurons with fluorescein by simple 
   immersion of animals in the dye. Mutants in five unc genes showed guidance 
   defects in these neurons, with processes either growing erratically in 
   abnormal locations, or stopping prematurely.  Several mutants are also 
   known in which the outgrowth of the touch neurons is defective (Chalfie and 
   Suslton, 1983).  Further studies have been undertaken using monoclonal 
   antibodies (S. McIntire, S. Siddiqui and J. Culotti, unpublished) and by 
   electron microscopereconstruction of mutants (J. White, unpublished).  <br>
   <br>
   The study of neural outgrowth undertaken here has concentrated on the 
   ventral cord, and to a lesser extent the ganglia at either end (RVG and 
   PAG).  Figure 1.3 shows in schematic form all the neurons and nerve 
   processes behind the RVG in a newly hatched L1 larva.  The ventral cord 
   contains the motor neurons that innervate body muscles as well as 
   interneuron processes that run to and from the nerve ring.  There are two 
   groups of processes in the ventral cord, one on each side of the hypodermal 
   ridge.  They are very asymetrical.  The right hand cord contains 25 to 30 
   processes, including the motor neuron processes and many pairs of 
   interneurons which are bilaterally symmetric in the nerve ring, while the 
   left hand cord contains only 3 or 4 processes.  The other main longitudinal 
   bundle is the dorsal cord, which contains motor neurons processes and just 
   one interneuron, <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RID;class=Cell">RID</a>. 
   <br>
   <br>
   The ventral and dorsal cords contain the motor circuitry controlling body 
   movement.  There are three classes of motor neuron at the L1 stage, <a 
   class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a>, <a 
   class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> and <a 
   class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> (five 
   more classes are added during postembryonic development).  In addition to 
   having their cell body and a process in the ventral cord, all these motor 
   neurons send a commissure round the body of the animal to the dorsal cord, 
   where they have another process.  Muscle arms from ventral muscles extend 
   to the ventral cord, while those from dorsal muscles extend to the dorsal 
   cord.  Movement of the body is limited to the dorsal-ventral plane. The 
   head has more freedom of movment, owing ot more complex innervation of the 
   muscles in the head directly from the nerve ring, but motion of the whole 
   animal is caused by propogating dorsal-ventral waves along the body.  <a 
   class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> and <a 
   class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> neurons 
   both have their neuromuscular output in the dorsal cord, and receive input 
   from (different) interneurons in the ventral cord.  However they have 
   different polarities: both ventral and dorsal <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> processes grow 
   forward, while <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> processes grow 
   backward.  <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> motor neurons 
   receive input in the dorsal cord from the <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> and <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> neurons, by 
   &#239;ntercepting" their neuromuscular junctions, and have output in the 
   ventral cord, which is thought to be inhibitory, ensuring relaxation of the 
   ventral musculature while the dorsal musculature is contracted.

   anterior is at the top, and posterior at the bottom.  The positions of the 
   four longitudinal muscle quadrants are shown by hatched regions.  Nerve 
   processes in C. elegans branch only rarely and reproducibly and all the 
   branches in this region are shown.  Processes entering the ventral, lateral 
   or dorsal cords from the front are indicated at the top.  Those with 
   asterisk after the neuron's name only run part way back along the body.  
   Posterior interneuron processes running forward along the ventral cord are 
   indicated at the top.  Those with an asterisk after the neuron's name only 
   run part way back along the body.  Posterior interneuron processes running 
   forward along the ventral cord are indicated similarly at the front of the 
   preanal ganglion.  All the anterior axons in the ventral cord without an 
   asterisk terminate in the preanal ganglion, except for that of AVG, which 
   is shown ascending into the dorsorectal ganglion.  The PHA and PHB neurons 
   from the lumbar ganglia also have posteriorly directed processes that 
   terminate in the phasmid sensilla.  Note the different directionalities of 
   outgrowth of the different ventral cord motor neuron classes.

   ridges.  In the front half of the animal there are four processes running 
   back under each muscle quadrant from the nerve ring.  These sublateral 
   processes are possibly proprioceptive, involved in controlling head 
   movement, since the neurons they belong to are closely associated with the 
   head motor circuitry, <a class=cell

   There are both practical and strategic reasons for choosing the ventral 
   cord as the target for study.  First, although the final anatomy of the 
   nerve ring has been reconstructed, it is too complex a structure to be able 
   to easily study its development. Its final structure is, however, discussed 
   with respect to developmental considerations in the second part of this 
   thesis. Second, the method of observation used has been reconstructed from 
   electron micrographs, and it is relatively easy to reconstruct the ventral 
   cord region from transverse sections, since processes are mostly 
   lonitudinal, any commissures containing only a few processes.  Third, and 
   perhaps most importantly, it is possible to at least some extent to examine 
   functionality defects in ventral cord structure, which allows the combining 
   of work on structure and function.  A reasonable functional model of the 
   ventral cord motor circuitry has been proposed, both by analogy to the 
   results in Ascaris and as a result of ablation experiments in which 
   components of the circuitry were removed (Chalfie <i>et al.</i>, 1985). 
   Movement is very easily observed, and a large number of uncoordinated 
   mutants have been ovtained that have various defects in movement (Brenner, 
   1974).  <br>
   <br>
   As mentioned previously, some of these mutants have been seen to have 
   defects in nerve process morphology (Hedgecock et al., 1985 S. McIntire, J. 
   White unpublished observations). Particular examples are that some or all 
   circumferential commissures go astray in <a class=cell

   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/locus?name=unc-76;class=Locus"><I>unc-76</I></a>  mutants. 
   These defects suggest that the affected genes may be involved in the 
   processes of neural outgrowth that have been studied here.  Genes defined 
   in this way provide a possible link between the anatomical experiments and 
   observations described here and the molecular mechanisms involved.  The 
   defects they induce are compared with the wild type development and the
