   <P>This thesis was written in 1987 and has not been updated since. The 
   discussion of related literature is therefore severely out of date. It is 
   being made available because it provides the primary source for quite a lot 
   of material that was not published elsewhere, in particular concerning the 
   early outgrowth of neurons in the ventral and dorsal cords.
