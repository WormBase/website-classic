<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<p class=boxed>
The results of the various observations and experiments described in this 
dissertation have been discussed already in their own sections.  Therefore 
instead of rehashing the same arguments I propose here to consider these 
results in the light of previous experience with using <i>C. elegans</i> as 
a model developmental animal, and to speculate in which type of direction 
future work, particularly on the genetics of neural specification, might 
take us. <BR>
<BR>
The studies described in both parts of this dissertation have relied on the 
fact that the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system is both extremely simple and 
highly reproducible, so that information can be gained from a comparatively 
small amount of data.  However there is also a possible penalty to be paid 
in studying an organism with a very small number of cells, all of which are 
reproducible from individual to individual.  These properties potentially 
permit structures to be put together piecemeal by some form of internal 
program specific to each part, rather than by general mechanisms. <BR>
<BR>
The initial reason for attempting a computer database analysis of the 
synapse and connectivity data was to attempt to find internal logical 
patterns in the connectivity data which might allow rules to be proposed 
for specifying which cells connected to which, for instance by placing the 
neurons in possibly overlapping &quot;super-classes&quot; that might have 
common recognition properties, so that if two cells were in compatible 
classes and also in contact then they would form a connection.  There are 
examples of pairs or groups of cells that are in different places and make 
mostly different connections, but which make similar connections to cells 
that they both contact, and which share other properties in common (White 
et al., 1983).  However an overall search for such grouping reveals nothing 
that is statistically significant.  One possible problem that may be 
important is that regional specialisation of neurons, as discussed in 
Chapter 7, would create complications in any search for classes of neurons 
with equivalent synaptic potential.  This does not mean that label receptor 
matching systems for determining synaptic connectivity do not exist, but 
merely that there are too few cells and there is too much variation to 
deduce them from the final connectivity data. <BR>
<BR>
A similar observation was made when the complete cell lineage was 
determined, which is more reproducible than the nervous system.  Although 
there are a few suggestive repeated motifs, the overall arrangement of 
which precursors produce which cells is essentially haphazard and mosaic, 
correlating as much with position as with pattern in the lineage (Sulston, 
1983).  This could be taken to indicate that external interactions with 
extracellular environment were important in determining cell fate, but 
abalation experiments largely revealed no effect on adjacent cells (Sulston 
and White, 1980, Sulston et al., 1983).  Overall this suggests intrinsic 
programming, but it has an advantage for the study of intercellular 
determination, which is that those instances where specific cell 
interaction is important, of which there are a number of clear examples 
(Sulston and White, 1980), may be comparatively isolated.  A number of the 
cell lineage mutants that have been obtained affect situations where 
induction or regulation takes place (Sternberg and Horvitz, 1984), and 
these may provide an excellent tool to study specific determinitive cell 
interactions during development <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i>.  One particular gene 
of this type has recently been cloned and sequenced, and its protein 
sequence has homology to a family of extacellular proteins including growth 
factors and their receptors (Greenwald, 1985).  Indeed there is an argument 
that clean developmental switch genes, which cause the change of cell fate 
from one type to another, will often be associated with inductive or 
regulative situations: a defect in a single component of an extracellular 
signalling pathway, such as the signal or the receptor, would cause an 
effective loss of signal, while internal choice determination may be a 
complex activity requiring many components simultaneously at each stage, 
and with no clear default behaviour.  Having obtained one of the components 
for an interactive mechanism via a mutant, one then has a genetic handle on 
the subsequent parts of the mechanism. <BR>
<BR>
The relative positioning of neuronal processes is much more complex than 
that of most other types of cells, and it must be expected that a large 
amount of intracellular interaction is required for process positioning and 
synapse formation.  However much of this may be non-specific.  As with the 
lineage ablation studies, the ablation experiments described in Chapter 4 
in general had remarkably little effect on other cells.  The <a class=cell

class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD5;class=Cell">DD5</a>, 
<a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> removal experiments showed no immediate effect on guidance of 
other neurons at all.  As discussed in Chapter 5 there are already mutants 
affecting process guidance in various ways.  There are also mutants known 
that affect synaptic connectivity in the ventral and dorsal nerve cords in 
a way that can be interpreted as switching the specificity of certain cells 
from one type to another (J. White, L. Nawrocki, personal communication). 
It is possible that some of these mutants may also affect comparatively 
isolated determinative intercellular interactions, which may provide models 
for similar interactions in more complex animals.  Even if not they may 
still reveal interesting mechanisms involved in specific guidance and 
synaptic connectivity.  However, by itself, genetics can be problematical 
because it may be hard to determine what one is studying.  It is ultimately 
in combining genetics with the detailed and specific anatomical 
observations and experiments that are possible in such a simple organism 
that I believe <BR>
<I>C. elegans</I> has most to offer development neuroscience.  If I were to 
continue working with <I>C. elegans</I> I would investigate the early 
anatomical development of some of the guidance mutants and follow up the 
molecular and genetic opportunities they generate.
