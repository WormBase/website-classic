7.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Synaptic distributions</H3>
   <p class=boxed>Altogether there are 3462 chemical synapses and 754 gap
   junctions between the 183 neurons in the H series database.  The
   two different types of connection, gap junctions and chemical
   synapses, are distributed rather differently in the nervous system,
   as can be seen from table 7.1.  Table 7.1 rows a) and b) show the
   proportion of pairs of adjacent processes that are connected by
   chemical synapses or by gap junctions.  <br><br>Although there are
   4.5 times as many chemical synapses as gap junctions, the
   proportion of pairs of adjacent cells connected by chemical
   synapses is similar to that connected by gap junctions (9% and 7%
   respectively).  This is because a pair of cells is often connected
   by several chemical synapses, but rarely by more than one or two
   gap junctions.  In other organisms there may be hundreds or
   thousands of synapses between a given pair of neurons (e.g. a
   cerebellar basket cell make many synapses on a Purkinje cell).  The
   small number of synapses in <i>C. elegans</i>  is probably due to the
   extremely small size of the entire nervous system.  </p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.2">
7.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjacency and synapse formation</H3>
   <p class=boxed>It is immediately obvious from table 7.1 (rows a, b) that
   both the probability of being connected by a chemical synapse, and
   the number of synapses actually formed, are highly correlated with
   adjacency.  There is a 14 fold increase in the proportion of
   connections formed when pairs of cells that have a high adjacency
   are compared with pairs that touch only briefly.  This correlation
   is far less marked for gap junctions, for which the corresponding
   increase is only a factor of two.  While the bast majority of
   chemical synapses are between pairs of cells with adjacency greater
   than 10, nearly half the gap junctions are between cells with
   adjacency less than or equal to 5.  <br><br>It might be thought that
   the increase in the average number of synapses formed with higher
   adjacencies provides evidence that synapse formation is dependant
   on the area of contact.  However, for any given pair of neurons it
   is possible to show that the number of synapses made between them
   does not substantially change with their adjacency.  This proposal
   can be tested by considering pairs A, B which have contralateral
   homologues A', B'.  In general A', B' will have a different
   adjacency from that of A, B, and they will often also form a
   different number of synapses.  If we assume that the symaptic
   formation mechanisms for symmetrical pairs on the two sides are
   equivalent then we can test statistically whether the number of
   synapses formed tends to vary proportionally with the adjacency, or
   remains independent of adjacency.  The details of the test are
   given in the appendix, but the results are as follows.  There were
   391 pairs of processes which formed synapses on both sides and
   showed different adjacencies on the two sides, and the value of the
   test statistic was 7103 with an expected standard error of around
   1330.  If the number of synapses varied proportionally with
   adjacency then the value should ideally be 0, while if it was
   independent the value should be around 7655.  It is clearly many
   standard error values from 0, and only about half a standard error
   distance from 7655.  Therefore there is strong evidence against a
   proportional system, and the data are consistent with the number of
   synapses between a given pair of neurons being determined
   independently of the adjacency.  The slightly lower value of the
   calculated test statistic than that expected by a wholly
   independent model can be explained by the fact that there must be
   some effect at very low adjacencies.  If the adjacency is 0 then
   clearly no synapses can be made, and when it is only 1 or 2 there
   are spatial limitations preventing a large number of synapses being
   formed.  </p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.3">
7.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reciprocal synapses and joint chemical/electrical connections</H3>
   <p class=boxed>It is important to consider the correlation between synapse
   formation and adjacency when looking for statistical interactions
   between the different types of synapse.  For instance, the
   frequency of reciprocal chemical synapses is consistent with
   synapses being independently specified in each direction.  Although
   the overall probability of a connection from neuron B to neuron A
   given one from A to B is high (14% as opposed to 9%, see table
   7.1 row c), this is because most of the pairs with a synapse from A
   to B have high adjacency, and so are more likely than normal to
   have a reverse synapse from B to A. When the probability of a
   reverse synapse is shown separately for each adjacency range, as in
   table 7.1, it can be seen to be essentially the same, or possibly
   slightly lower, as that for an unconditional synapse.  <br><br>The
   same approach can be used to consider whether there is any
   statistical interaction between chemical synapses and gap
   junctions.  In this case there is a slight negative correlation,
   since the probability of a gap junction between a pair of cells
   that are linked by chemical synapses is reduced by 1 or 2 percent
   from the unconditional probability in each adjacency range (table
   7.1 row d).  This difference can be partly explained by the fact
   that a significant proportion (66/284) of gap junctional
   connections are between members of the same neuronal class, while
   it is rare for there to be intraclass chemical synapses (discussed
   below).  <br><br>Therefore the presence of one type of connection
   between cells does not provide any indication of whether another
   type, either gap junctional or chemical in the opposite direction,
   will also be present.  The only exception to this is when the cells
   are members of the same class, in which case if there are chemical
   synapses (only 5 examples) then they tend to be reciprocal (4/5),
   as would be expected.  Together with the overall dependence of
   synapse formation on adjacency these results mean that there is a
   remarkably high probability of some form of connection between
   processes that have a high adjacency.  If the adjacency is greater
   than 10 then the proportion of pairs forming either a gap junction
   or a chemical synapse one way or the other is 47% (478/1020).</p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.4">
7.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Connections between members of the same neuronal class</H3>
   <p class=boxed>Gap junctions are far more frequent than normal when both
   cells are members of the same neuronal class.  The 302 neurons in
   <i>C. elegans</i>  have been put into 118 different classes on the base of
   similar morphology and connectivity (White <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  Many of
   these classes, particularly those with processes in the nerve ring,
   consist of a pair of bilateral, symmetry related neurons.  There
   are 61 such pairs in which the two cells make physical contact and
   35 (57%) of these have gap junctions while only 5 (8%) have
   chemical synapses.  <br><br>It is common for there to be a gap
   junction where the ends of two processes from different members of
   the same neuronal class abut, such as when left and right symmetry
   related processes meet at the top of the nerve ring.  This abuttal
   is interesting in itself, since it suggests that the processes
   might stop growing when they establish contact with the tips of
   their contralateral homologues.  A similar phenomenon is seen in
   the ventral and dorsal nerve cords, where the processes from
   consecutive neurons of two classes of motor neuron (<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VD</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a>) abut
   and make gap junctions but do not overlap; the other classes
   overlap (except <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">AS</a>), and sometimes make gap junctions.  In the ring
   there are 24 pairs of cells whose processes end where they meet at
   the dorsal midline, and a gap junction is present in 22 of these
   cases.  Of the 37 other classes of cells that have interclass cell
   contacts, but which do not abut, only 13 interclass gap junctions. 
   None of the pairs that form internal chemical synapses abut, nor do
   any of interneurons that send adjacent processes back along the
   ventral cord; perhaps if they had inhibited each other's growth
   they could not have grown out together along the cord.  </p>

      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.5">
7.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reproducibility of connections</H3>
   <p class=boxed>There are two sources of synaptic reproducibility that might
   be expected in the database.  The first is from animal to animal,
   and the second is due to internal bilateral symmetry within one
   animal.  Most neuronal classes that are associated with the nerve
   ring, and so represented in the database, consist of one or more
   bilateral pairs of homologous neurons.  One problem with the
   comparison between animals is that the U series animal was an
   adult, while the H series animal was an L4 larva.  Although almost
   all neural development in the nerve ring is embryonic the
   sex-specific circuitry concerned with egg laying is incomplete in
   the H series, and there may be other less obvious differences due
   to age.  <br><br>The probability that a given pair of H series
   neurons A, B will be connected by chemical synapses if their
   contralateral homologues !' and B' are connected is 87%, while the
   probability that they will be connected if their U series
   homologues Au and Bu are connected is only 75% (table 7.2 rows a,
   b).  The corresponding figures for gap junctions are 89% and 79%
   (table 7.2 rows c, d).  It therefore appears that gap junctional
   connections are slightly more reproducible than synaptic ones and
   that the two sides of the same animal are more similar than the two
   different animals.  Part of the difference in chemical synaptic
   connectivity between the two animals is that there are more
   chemical synapse connections in the U series than the H series (916
   as opposed to 819), and the extra connections are certain to be
   unmatched.  However the difference between the animals is still
   probably significant because there are fewer U series gap junction
   connections than ones in the H series (260 against 284) but a lower
   proportion of U series gap junctions are matched in the H series
   than ones of the opposite side of the H series (above).  <br><br>The
   difference between the "within animals" (left/right) comparison and
   the "between animals" (H/U) comparison can be further illustrated
   by considering the pairs that form connections in only two of the
   four possible places (each side of each animal).  There are six
   ways that this can happen: both sides of the H series but not at
   all in the U series, both sides of the U series but not in the H
   series, and four different ways that there could be one synapse in
   the U series and one in the H series.  If the similarity between
   animals were the same as that between sides of the same animal then
   the size of all these classes should be the same: the number of
   pairs synapsing only in the H series, and the number synapsing only
   in the U series, should be a quarter of the number that synapse
   just once in the H series and once in the U series.  In fact there
   are 23 pairs that synapse only in the H series, 51 only in the U
   series, and 64 that synapse once in each series.  For gap junctions
   these numbers are 41, 22 and 14.  In both cases there are more
   connections than expected that are U series specific or H series
   specific, indicating that there are significant differences between
   the two animals.  <br><br>Similarly, a test can be performed to
   detect whether there is also a reproducible difference between the
   right and left sides of the nerve ring.  If there was such a
   difference then one would expect that the connection between a pair
   of Au,Bu in the U series would resemble more closely that between
   their exact equivalents in the H series, A,B, than that between the
   corresponding cells on the contralateral side, A' and B'.  In fact
   the figures are 75% reproducibility to A,B, 74% to A'B' for
   chemical synapses, and 79% to A,B, 77% to A',B' for gap
   junctions.  Therefore if there is consistent difference between the
   two sides it is very slight (1 or 2%).  It would not be possible
   to identify the source of any consistent difference that may be
   reflected in this small change of reproducibility, because there is
   too much noise from the difference between the two animals.  </p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.6">
7.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reproducibility depends on the number of synapses made,
   not on adjacency</H3> <p class=boxed>Overall the observed levels of
   reproducibility suggest that there is an underlying regular
   pattern.  In particular the two sides of the same animal appear to
   be sufficiently similar to allow us to assume that they were
   subject to the same synaptic specification procedure during
   development.  This allows us to consider some aspects of the
   question of how neural connectivity is determined.  By identifying
   the sources of inaccuracy of synaptic reproducibility it is
   possible to obtain information about, and thus to make suggestions
   about, the mechanisms for establishment of specific circuitry. 
   This approach has already been used to indicate the independence of
   the number of synapses made between a pair of neurons from their
   adjacency.  All the effects we will consider would not be altered
   significantly by one or two percent change due to possible slight
   genuine differences between the two sides.  <br><br>Although it
   appeared at first sight that there was an unexpectedly high
   variation in the formation of chemical synapses, almost all the
   inconsistencies are due to the unreliability of weak connections,
   i.e. connections with only a small number of synapses.  For pairs
   connected by three or more synapses (which is true for about two
   thirds of connected pairs) the probability that their homologues
   are connected is greater than 90%, whereas if there is only a
   single synapse then the probability that their homologues will be
   connected is only around a half.  This difference exists both
   between and within animals (for exact numbers see table 7.2). 
   <br><br>Clearly one cause of a mismatch in which a connection seen
   is present on one side but missing on the other might be that the
   neurons are not in contact in the case where the synapse is
   missing.  However if they do touch each other then the dependence
   of reproducibility on the number of synapses made is practically
   independent of adjacency.  If we consider A, B such that A' and B'
   are connected by only one synapse then the probability of
   connection between A and B is around 60% in all adjacency ranges. 
   At the other extreme if A' and B' are connected by three or more
   synapses then the probability that A and B are connected is 79%
   (11/14) if their adjacency is one or two, and more than 95% in any
   adjacency range greater than two (table 71 rows e, f).  It is
   necessary to consider the data this way, because a direct
   comparison of reproducibility at different adjacencies would
   suggest that adjacency is an important factor (table 7.2 rows a, b,
   final columns).  In fact this effect is mostly secondary, caused by
   the fact that connections with higher adjacency tend to have a
   larger number of synapses.  If we combine this result with the
   earlier observation that the number of synapses made between a
   given pair of neurons is essentially independent of adjacency, then
   it appears that, except at very low adjacencies, the probability
   that two given processes will form a synapse is also practically
   independent of their adjacency.  The overall correlation between
   synapse formation and adjacency (Table 1, row a) therefore implies
   that the physical organisation of processes is such that neurons
   that repoducibly synapse tend to have higher adjacencies.  This is
   considered further in the discussion.  <br><br>The picture that
   emerges is that pairs of neurons are programmed to make an
   approximately predetermined number of synapses, and that the
   connection will be more reliable if this number is greater than one
   or two.  There is no significant similar set of results for gap
   junctions, because, as far as numbers of junctions are concerned,
   more than three quarters of gap junctional connections involve only
   one gap junction, and as regards adjacency, there is very little
   correlation between the presence of gap junctions and adjacency. 
   It is however true that in the cases where there are two or more
   gap junctions on one side the chance of there being at least one on
   the other side is higher than normal (94%).  </p>

<p>
         <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.7">
7.7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mismatches of chemical synapses are due to extra
   connections more often than to missing connections</H3> <p class=boxed>If we
   assume that there is an underlying "normal" pattern of connectivity
   then there are essentially two ways that a mismatch can occur. 
   Either an additional abnormal connection can be made, or a normal
   connection can be missing.  For any given connection involving a
   bilaterally represented neuronal class there are four equivalent
   possible locations that the connection could occur in the database,
   one on each side of each animal.  If a mismatch exists in one
   animal then one can look in the other animal to get some idea of
   whether the connection is normally there or not.  For chemical
   synapses there are over four times as many connections that occur
   in only one of the four cases as in three out of four cases (137
   and 32 respectively).  This implies that four times as many
   mismatches are due to a single extra connection being present as
   are due to a single connection being missing.  The same is not true
   of gap junctional connections, for which there are 74 present in
   only one case and 58 in three cases.  <br><br>These observations
   concerning unmatched chemical synaptic connections suggest that
   there are a set of extra synapses in addition to a fairly
   consistent set of basic connections.  We can attempt to estimate
   the consistent set of synapses by counting only those synapses in
   addition to a fairly consistent set of basic connections.  We can
   attempt to estimate the consistent set of synapses by counting only
   those synapses that are seen in three or four of the possible cases
   (both cases if both members of the pair of neurons are unique). 
   There are 2890 of these synapses per animal, leaving 1184 extra
   synapses altogether in both animals, associated with 647 different
   cell pair types.  Some of these synapses are between cells that are
   already connected by consistent synapses.  However less than half
   (498) fall into this class; those that do so add fairly evenly to
   consistent connections with both more and fewer consistent
   synapses.  The remainder (686) are formed between pairs that are
   not consistently connected.  There is a tendency for these to be
   between processes that have higher adjacency; 437 are between
   processes with average adjacency 6 or greater.  <br><br>White (1983)
   suggested that mismatches might arise because synaptic connections
   were only specified between processes that are normally adjacent,
   so that if a nerve process was misplaced and acquired new
   unexpected neighbours it might make additional, incorrect
   connections to some of them.  There is quite a large variation in
   the set of cells contacted by any neuron, since if A is adjacent to
   B then the probability of A' being adjacent to B' is only about
   75% (7028/9214).  However this is not the predominant source of
   mismatches.  If A' is not adjacent to B' the probability of a
   connection from A to B is far smaller than normal (table 7.1 row g
   compared to row a).  Only about a quarter of all mismatches can be
   explained in this fashion (24/108 for the bilateral comparison and
   65/224 for the H/U comparison - 5th column of table 7.2).  The
   proportions are similar for gap junctions (8/32 and 10/55
   respectively).  These results suggest first that specificity is
   probably determined for at least an extension of the normal set of
   neighbours, covering processes with which a neuron is likely to
   stray into contact, and second that physical contact is not a major
   limiting factor in determining synapse formation, since most of the
   marginal synapses are made with processes with which the neuron is
   normally in contact.  Instead the earlier observations suggest that
   additional synapses are mostly made between processes that normally
   have reasonable adjacency.  </p>
               <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.8">
7.8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Connections are not determined purely by neuronal classes</H3>
   <p class=boxed>So far we have compared pairs of neurons that are directly
   symmetry related, such as A, B to A' B'.  There are also many
   situations where a neuron B contacts both A and its contralateral
   homologue A'.  These contacts are not symmetry related, but if
   connections are determined purely by the classes of the two
   neurons, then one would expect a connection between A and B
   whenever there was one between A' and B. In fact the overall
   measures of this type of reproducibility are 67% for chemical
   synapses and 57% for gap junctions (table 7.2 rows e and f
   respectively), significantly less than the levels of
   reproducibility for are 67% for chemical synapses and 57% for gap
   junctions (table 7.2 rows e and f respectively), significantly less
   than the levels of reproducibility for symmetry related connections
   (rows a, c).  The given frequencies of a matching connection from A
   to B are conditional on A and B being adjacent, since there is no
   automatic reason why A and B should be adjacent whenever A' and B
   are, ecause there is no geometrical symmetry relating to the two
   pairs.  This difference is dreproducible in the symmetric
   left/right comparison.  The only set of conditions under which
   there is a respectable degree of reproducibility is when the
   adjacency of A to B is high (column 7).  <br><br>What might cause
   the difference between A and A'' in synaptic specificity with
   respect to B? If the difference is cell intrinsic, as opposed to
   being activity related, then either A and A' must be inherently
   distinguishable or else either they or B must be regionally
   specialised.  Regional specialisation would account for the
   observations because in general different parts of A and A' contact
   B, and they contact it in different places (see figure 7.1 for an
   example concerning cells all of the same class).  There are several
   indications that suggest that this might be a correct explanation. 
   Although few neurons in the <i>C. elegans</i>  nerve ring have a classical
   bipolar morphology, with a presynaptic dendritic structure and a
   predominantly postsynaptic axonal structure, there are many neurons
   whose processes show regional differences (White <i>et al.</i>, 1983,
   White <i>et al.</i>, 1986), and most of the cases of differential
   specificity that we are considering, such as that between the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">RMD</a>
   neurons shown in figure 7.1, involve these cells.  In addition, if
   the differences were due to regional specialisation, then there
   would be the highest chance of a mismatch if the cells only touched
   in one place, and much less chance if they were in contact over a
   large proportion of their axonal structure.  This suggests that the
   mismatch frequency would be lower when the adjacency of A and B was
   high, which is indeed the case (table 7.2 column 7).  Such an
   effect would not be expected if the difference between A'B and AB
   synapses was due to distinct identificatory labelling of A and A'. 
   <br><br>Similar results are obtained when comparing synaptic
   specificity of dorsal and ventral members of the same neuronal
   class.  Once again their interactions with other neurons are not
   symmetry related, and so the lower levels of reproducibility that
   are observed (69% for chemical synapses and 52% for gap
   junctions) can be explained by regional specialisation of some of
   the neurons.  ue neither to the number of connections from A' to B
   tending to be low nor to the adjacency of A and B being low, since
   there is still a difference when the frequency is tabulated with
   respect to either of these categories (columns 2 and 6 of table 2). 
   Indeed the reproducibility is down to 70% even in the cases where
   there are 3 or more synapses, which are 95% </p>

    A schematic diagram showing the interconnections between the 6 members of 
    the RMD class of neurons.  The circle represents the nerve ring.  At each 
    radial position around the ring one of the RMD neurons has synaptic output 
    (arrows), both onto muscle and onto other neurons, including the 
    diametrically opposite RMD neuron, which „intercepts¾ the neuromuscular 
    junctions (as with the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> process in figure 3.6).  In general the RMD 
    neurons are monopolar, with their proximal regions showing this 
    intercepting behaviour, and their distal regions being synaptically active.  
    Gap junctions (thin bars) link neighbouring neuromuscular regions but are 
    not formed in general even where processes are close, sich as for instance 
    where chemical synapses are made.  Some variability was seen in this 
    general pattern, since in the U series <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RMDL;class=Cell">RMDL</a> had output (both to muscle and 
    other neurons) from the proximal as well as the distal part of its 
    process).

7.8.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion</H4>
   <p class=boxed>The main conclusions of this set of investigations 
   are:<BR><BR>
   1. The overall pattern of connectivity between neurons is
       fairly reproducible.  However at a detailed level there are
       differences.  There is a greater difference between the two
       animals than between the two sides of one animal.  
<BR>
2. Although chemical synapse formation is correlated with
       adjacency when all pairs of neurons are considered, between any
       particular pair both the probability of forming a connection,
       and the number of synapses made, are essentially independent of
       adjacency.  
<BR>
3. Synaptic reproducibility is very high (over
       95%) if several synapses are normally made.  However there is
       a substantial number of unmatched single synapses, present in
       only one of two symmetrical cases.  A significant majority of
       unmatched chemical synapses appear to be due to the formation
       of abnormal or infrequently made connections, rather than the
       loss of a normal connection.  
<BR>
4. The formation of a
       connection between two neurons is not purely dependent on the
       classes of the neurons involved and whether they are adjacent. 
       A possible additional factor is that in many cases synaptic
       specificity is regionally localised on neurons.

I shall discuss these points in turn.</p>

7.9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences between repeats of equivalent circuitry</H3>
   <p class=boxed>There are two significant questions concerning the overall
   reproducibility of the synaptic connections in the nerve ring.  The
   first is whether the differences seen are systematic and
   functional, or merely random variation due to looking at an
   essentially fixed pattern at too fine a level of detail.  The
   second is whether the left and right sides of the nerve ring are
   developmentally equivalent in terms of synaptic circuitry.  Some
   parts of the nervous system show significant reproducible
   left/right asymmetry (e.g. the ventral nerve cord, see Chapter 5),
   but at a gross level the two sides of the ring are symmetrical. 
   These questions could be addressed by considering the four examples
   of each cell pair interaction present in the database, one for each
   side of each animal.  <br><br>To consider the second question first,
   a comparison was made to search for consistent synaptic differences
   between the left and right sides across the two animals.  This
   indicated that they were very similar, although there may be a
   slightly greater similarity overall between the same sides of the
   two animals than between their opposite sides (approximately 1%,
   the effect for instance of a single possible asymmetric neuron
   class).  This possible minor difference was ignored for the rest of
   the analysis in order to consider the two sides as developmentally
   equivalent when investigating their differences.  There was a
   certain amount of unsystematic variation between the two sides. 
   Clearly it is not easy to assess the functional significance of
   anatomical changes in synaptic connectivity in a circuit whose
   function is largely unknown.  However there was no obvious
   observable pattern to the differences that might have suggested a
   rewiring of any piece of the circuitry, such as loss of one
   connection but a gain of a compensating connection to a parallel
   interneuron, and the vast majority of differences involved
   connections with just one or two synapses, or a single gap
   junction.  It seems reasonable to suggest that the variation seen
   here is mostly due to random fluctuation in process positioning and
   synapse formation.  <br><br>The equivalent comparison between the
   two difference animals, however, revealed that the two sides of
   each animal were more similar than the same sides of different
   animals, suggesting possible real differences between the two
   animals.  The U series is from an older animal but again, except
   for the introduction of the major egg-laying motor neurons (<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=HSNL;class=Cell">HSNL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=HSNR;class=Cell">HSNR</a>)
   and a generally raised number of connections from the labial
   receptors (<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">IL1</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">IL2</a> classe), the differences appear to be scattered
   randomly throughout the circuitry, and to consist mostly of only
   one or two synapses for any particular pair of cells.  Since the
   animals are isogenic, the systematic differences must be either age
   related, or a consequence of environmental differences during
   development.  Laboratory specimens of <i>C. elegans</i>  are cultured on
   bacterial lawns grown on agar plates; their environment varies only
   in the level of food supply and the degree of dessication!  There
   have been no studies to determine whether any of the <i>C. elegans</i> 
   neural circuitry shows variation under different conditions.  A
   possible approach would be to compare the ventral nerve cord
   circuitry of animals that have been raised swimming freely in
   liquid culture with the standard nerve cord of animals raised on
   agar plates, which has been reconstructed many times.  </p>

7.10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Connection formation and adjacency</H3>
   <p class=boxed>A simple model for formation of synapses between two neurons
   would be that there is a cell-cell recognition event where the
   cells contact, and that synapse formation is a local event, so that
   the probability of forming a synapse, and the number formed, would
   increase with increasing length of mutual contact.  However there
   is clear evidence from the variation in adjacency and synapse
   formation in equivalent pairs of cells in the database that this is
   not the case.  Both the probability of forming a synapse, and the
   number of synapses formed, are essentially independent of the
   degree of adjacency, providing that some contact is made.  This
   implies that there is internal regulation of synapse formation at a
   cell-wide level.  Such regulation is biologically reasonable,
   because it would be asking a lot of a process placement mechanism
   to finely control the exact amount of contact between different
   neurons, and the circuitry is reasonably fixed.  Indeed the
   adjacency of a particular pair of neurons is much more variable
   than their connectivity.  The next chapter pursues further the
   question of process placement in the nerve ring.  <br><br>Although
   there is no apparent link at the level of individual process pairs,
   there is a strong general correlation between synapse formation and
   adjacency.  Neuron pairs that are synaptically connected tend to
   have high adjacencies, and the more synapses they form the higher
   the adjacency tends to be.  The amount of contact is in general
   much larger than that needed to make the synapses in.  In a sense
   adjacency seems to depend on the likelihood of forming synapses,
   rather than synapse formation on adjacency.  This also makes
   biological sense, since the goal of positioning nerve processes is
   to place in contact with each other those neurons that will form
   connections.  However the same correlation is not seen for gap
   junctions, for which this post hoc biological rationale is just as
   relevant.  This seems to suggest an effect on neuronal placement,
   and thus possibly process guidance, of either chemical synapses or
   gap junctions (or something involved in forming them).  One might
   postulate either process attraction linked with synapse formation,
   or a repulsion, or stopping of growth, associated with gap
   junctions.  When considering connections within the same class it
   was observed that bilaterally symmetric processes that gap junction
   with each other often terminate when they meet at the midline,
   while those few classes that form intraclass synapses all
   substantially overlap.  Elsewhere in <i>C. elegans</i>  the muscle arms in
   the body are clearly attracted to the presynaptic processes, since
   when motor neuron axons are displaced the muscle arms still go to
   them and receive neuromuscular input (Chapter 4, and J White, S
   Brenner, unpublished observations).  However, although muscle arms
   resemble postsynaptic processes, they are phylogenetically
   anomalous and possibly a special example.  </p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.11">
7.11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;An underlying pattern of connectivity with additions?</H3>
   <p class=boxed>The average number of chemical synapses between a pair of
   synaptically connected neurons 4.2, and there are many cases with
   more than 10 synapses, whereas there are rarely more than one or
   two gap junctions between a pair of neurons.  We have seen that in
   individual cases the level of adjacency between two processes does
   not appear to be important to synaptic reproducibility.  Instead
   the most significant general factor as an indicator of
   reproducibility is the number of synapses made.  Connections with
   only one or two synapses are unreliable, while those normally
   containing many synapses are nearly all present in all cases.  This
   result is statistical; there may be individual pairs of neurons
   that always connect but only form one synapse (e.g. <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=OLQV;class=Cell">OLQV</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RICL;class=Cell">RICL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RICR;class=Cell">RICR</a>
   only contact briefly but in each case seen make a single very large
   synapse full of vesicles).  However overall there is evidence that
   the probability of forming a connection and the number of synapses
   are linked.  <br><br>If we consider mismatches in which a connection
   is present on one side but not the other, there are four times as
   many cases where the connection is seen on neither side of the
   other animal as ones in which it is seen on both sides.  An
   explanation of this result would be provided by the hypothesis that
   there is an underlying pattern of circuitry that is consistently
   present, but there are also always a number of additional synapses
   that are selected from a wide range of possibilities, and which
   therefore do not generate reproducible connections.  The
   distribution of this set of additional synapses was estimated by
   subtracting away consistently seen synapses.  Since this operation
   was performed with synapses rather than connections it leaves some
   additional synapses between processes which have a consistent
   connection, for example where in one of the four cases 10 synapses
   were made, and in others only 6.  However the majority of
   additional synapses are between processes that are not reproducibly
   connected, which implies that the variation observed in the
   circuitry is not simply due to modulation in level of a small
   restricted set of possible connections.  The new connections
   normally contain only one or two synapses.  This would provide an
   explanation for the low reproducibility of synaptic connections
   containing only one or two synapses.  Both the adjacency
   distribution of the additional synapses, and a direct count of the
   proportion of mismatches for which the unconnected pair of neurons
   are not adjacent, indicate that most of the additional connections
   are between pairs of neurons that normally have a reasonable
   adjacency, rather than being due to a process wandering away from
   its normal circle of connections.  <br><br>One possible alternative
   explanation for the extra "random" connections is that they are due
   to errors in scoring synapses during the reconstructions.  It is
   sometimes hard to unambiguously identify whether or not a process
   is postsynaptic to a particular synapse.  However the fact that the
   comparison between the U and H series contains many differences
   with similar characteristics to those described above, but many of
   which are reproducible from side to side of each animal, suggests
   that they are real.  </p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.12">
7.12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Localisation of synaptic specificity within neurons</H3>
   <p class=boxed>There are a significant number of cases where synapses or gap
   junctions are formed between members of two classes of neurons when
   they make contact in one place on their processes, but not when
   equivalent cells touch in other places.  It seems more likely that
   this is due to regional localistion of the potential to form the
   relevant type of synapse in the same way for all neurons in a
   class, than to all the different members of each class having
   different recognition properties.  A more direct example of clear
   localisation is seen in the adult ventral cord, where the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VA</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">VB</a>
   motor neurons are bipolar, sending out processes in one direction
   that only receive input, and only have neuromuscular output from
   their other process, a classical axon/dendrite morphology.  The
   interneurons are closely available to both processes.  However many
   of the ring neurons are not bipolar, and it would appear that many
   of the specialisations, presumably involving differential
   localisation of surface components, would have to be between distal
   and proximal regions of the same nerve process, as in figure 1. 
   The following neuronal classes can be tentatively implicated as
   candidates for regional specialisation on the grounds that they are
   involved in more than one mismatch and have a suggestive axonal
   structure: <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">RMD</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">SMD</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">SAA</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">SIB</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">SMB</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RICL;class=Cell">RICL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RICR;class=Cell">RICR</a>. There are many others with
   apparently discontinuous axonal structure (White <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  An
   example of a different type of change between proximal and distal
   regions of the same nerve process is given by the single neurite of
   the major interneuron <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBL;class=Cell">AIBL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AIBR;class=Cell">AIBR</a>, which changes relative position in the
   neuropil, running for the first half of its length with chemical
   receptor axons, and th distal half with motor neurons and motor
   circuitry interneurons (White <i>et al.</i>, 1983).</p>
   
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.13">
7.13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</H3>
   <p class=boxed>Two types of information can be inferred from the foregoing
   analysis.  First a picture can be drawn of the degree of overall
   synaptic rigidity in the <i>C. elegans</i>  nerve ring, and how the
   connectivity might vary or be modified.  Second there are a number
   of observations suggesting factors that might be important for the
   formation of synapses between individual pairs of neurons.  <br><br>
   It is apparent that synaptic circuitry in <i>C. elegans</i>  is not so
   rigidly reproducible as the positioning and lineal origin of cells,
   which are practically identical from animal to animal.  However the
   data support the suggestion that there is a broad core of
   connections that are constant, including most of the strong
   synaptic connections containing many synapses.  This core is
   subject to a reasonably low level of variation itself (at the level
   of one or two synapses per connection), but there are also a number
   of additional chemical synapses (about 10% of the number in the
   core pattern) connecting other pairs of processes, which are not
   reproducible.  Gap junctions show less variation, and no indication
   of a strong additional component.  <br><br>There is some evidence
   that the changes and additions might not be random, since there are
   many consistent ones, each small in itself, between the H series
   animal and the U series animal.  Since these two animals are
   isogenic they must be due to either environmental or age-related
   differences.  If the additions are functional then there are two
   possible ways in which they could be used.  The first is to
   "tinker" with a standard pattern, slightly altering the influence
   of various parts of the nervous system on each other but not
   changing the functional roles of cells.  The second is to introduce
   a new behaviour, or to flexibly wire a particular task so that it
   is performed in a different way in different animals.  This is
   different from the question of functional flexibility in a single
   neuron taking part in more than one task, for which there is plenty
   of evidence: the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">IL1</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">URA</a> classes are for instance both sensory
   and motor neurons.  Although no data are available on the
   variability of function of nerve ring neurons in different animals,
   I believe that two observations point towards the tinkering rather
   than the respecification theory.  First, in no case is a systematic
   pattern of connectivity change discernible (other than the
   introduction of the egg-laying circuitry in the sexually mature U
   series animal).  Second, the great majority of changes consist of
   only one or two synapses per connection.  <br><br>There are several
   observ ations concerning the formation of connections between pairs
   of neurons.  It seems likely that the potential to form synapses
   and gap junctions may be localisable to particular parts of a
   single process.  The probability of a chemical synaptic connection
   being formed, which may depend on environmental as well as genetic
   factors, and the number of synapses formed, appear to be regulated
   so as not to depend on the amount of contact between a pair of
   cells.  However the factors involved in synapse formation may
   influence adjacency, because synapse formation, but not gap
   junction formation, is correlated with adjacency, suggesting that
   one or the other of the two processes may have an effect on nerve
   process placement.  The evidence for these properties generated by
   this study is statistical and indirect, and therefore inappropriate
   as a basis for a series of direct intrusive testing experiments. 
   However it is not susceptible to the bias that might be generated
   by studying intensively a single connection.  Also, since a very
   large number of cell pairs were considered, it is statistically
   significant; the conclusions do almost certainly reflect pervasive
   properties of one simple nervous system, and they may also be
   relevant to other organisms.  </p>
