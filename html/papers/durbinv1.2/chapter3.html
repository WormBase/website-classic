3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pattern of Outgrowth in Normal Embryos</H2>
    <p class=boxed>The organisation of processes in the ventral nervous system is
    established during a short period of little more than an hour, at
    the same time as the animal is elongating in the eggshell from a
    stubby åtadpole' to a worm.  Electron microscope reconstructions
    of varying lengths were made from a series of four embryos at
    different developmental stages during this period (figure 3.1). 
    Figure 3.4 shows a schematic picture of the state of the ventral
    nervous system in each of the reconstructions, which will be
    referred to by the letters A to D. During the period covered by
    these reconstructions the embryo increases by a factor of about
    two in length, being about one and a half fold in the egg (100
    microns) at the time of the A reconstruction, and three and a half
    fold (220 microns) in the D reconstruction.  At the beginning of
    the period under consideration here the nerve ring contains the
    majority of the final number of processes.  Uncoordinated muscle
    activity has already started before the time of the A
    reconstruction (the onset of twitching is at about 430 mins). 
    Movement becomes more organised around the stage of the final, D
    reconstruction, although since the embryo is restricted inside the
    egg shell it is not possible to assess fully the degree of
    coordination.</p>
    
    <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc3.1"> 3.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Morphology of growth 
    cones</H3>
    
    <p class=boxed>
    Growth cones are generally extended flattened lamellar structures that also 
    have long thin filopodial extensions.  In C. elegans the most extensive 
    growth cones are seen on the growing tips of the motor neuron commissures. 
    Typically they are a flattened sheet a few tenths of a micron thick and of 
    variable shape and size in the plane of the sheet (figures 3.2, 3.5).  The 
    absence of normal looking filopodia may be due to the small scale (2-5 
    microns across); a vertebrate tissue culture growth cone could extend right 
    round the <i>C. elegans</i>  embryo.  However stubby finger-like extensions 
    are seen in many cases, and these may perform an equivalent function. 
    Figure 3.2 shows a three dimensional reconstruction of the complete cell <a 
    class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB4;class=Cell">DB4</a> 
    from the B reconstruction, in which the thin sheet-like nature of the 
    growth cone can be clearly seen.  <br>
    <br>
    Extended growth cones like those seen on commissures were not seen on 
    processes growing along the ventral or dorsal cords, although some tips do 
    have swollen or spread out endings (e.g. <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVCL;class=Cell">PVCL</a> 
    in figure 3.7).  This corresponds to observations made in other organisms 
    that process growing along pre-existing nerve bundles do not have such 
    extended growth cones as those growing over virgin territory (Lopresti 
    <i>et al.</i>, 1973). <br>
    <br>
    The quality of the cytoplasmic fixation in the embryos used for 
    reconstruction was poor, since primary fixation is with OsO4 follwed by 
    tannic acid, which fixes membranes well but leaves little cytoplasmic 
    structure.  Therefore neither actin microfiliaments nor microtubules are 
    preserved.  However in some cases it is possible to see vesicles in growth 
    cones, as for example in a commissural growth cone in the C reconstruction 
    (figure 1.1).  Studies by de Cino (1981) have indicated that transmitter is 
    sometimes released by growth cones.  An alternative explanation for the 
    vesicles is simply that they may be a source of new membrane for insertion 
    at the leading edge of the growth cone.

   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=CANL;class=Cell">CANL</a> (Neur Bod) on the side of the hypodermis (Hyp) 
    or on the side of the basement membrane (BM).  It passes on the hypodermal 
    side, as do all motor neuron commissures in similar situations.  This 
    suggests that commissural growth cones attach to and move over cell 
    surfaces rather than basement membrane.  From the C reconstruction.  Scale

    <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc3.2"> 3.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The attachment substrate for 
    growth cones</H3>
    
    <p class=boxed>
    Growth cones have been seen in vitro to extend very well over artifical 
    substrates made of basement membrane components, such as fibronectin and 
    laminin (Baron van Evercooren <i>et al.</i>, 1982).  This has led to the 
    suggestion that basement membrane may provide a favoured substrate for 
    growth cones to grow over.  It is possible in at least one case in <i>C. 
    elegans</i>  to determine the substrate on which the growth cone moves.  
    The motor neuron commissures grow out sandwiched between hypodermal cells 
    and the basement membrane.  There are several lateral neuronal cells that 
    also lie between the hypodermis and the basement membrane, in the way of 
    the growing commissures.  Whenever a commissural growth cones reaches a 
    lateral cell body it leaves the basement membrane and passes between the 
    hypodermis and the lateral neuron (figure 3.3).  There has never been 
    observed an exception to this rule. Thus it seems that the growth substrate 
    for these commissures is the surface of hypodermal cells, not the basement 
    membrane. <br>
    <br>
    A couple of similar results are provided by ablation experiments (Chapter 
    4) in which in one case <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD5;class=Cell">DD5</a> 
    moves from the right side of the cord to the left (after removing <a 
    class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>), 
    and in another case PVQL moves from the left to the right (after removing 
    <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a>). 
     In each case the process changing sides passes under a motor neuron cell 
    body, rather than over it, again maintaining contact with the hypodermis 
    rather than the basement membrane. There are many other examples where 
    processes grow between cell bodies and other processes, well removed from 
    the ectodermal basement membrane.  During later development several 
    posteembryonic processes grow the length of the ventral cord in the middle 
    of the main bundle of embryonic processes.  The embryonic reconstructions 
    presented here show processes from the lumbar ganglia growing forward 
    through the middle of the cluster of cell bodies in the preanal ganglion.  
    In general wherever there is evidence on the subject of neuronal growth 
    cone guidance in C. elegans it suggests that the substrate for growth is 
    the surface of other cells, rather than a basement membrane.  However this 
    does not rule out the possibility that the basement membrane is important 
    in certain cases.

      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc3.3">
3.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;AVG pioneers the ventral cord</H3>
     <p class=boxed>The first nerve process to grow along the ventral cord belongs to
    the interneuron <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>. <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> has its cell body in the retro-vesicular
    ganglion at the front of the ventral cord; it is an unpaired cell,
    and is the most posterior interneuron in the front of the animal
    to send a process back along the cord.  The cell body and process
    were identified in both the A and and B reconstructions.  By the A
    reconstruction the process has already grown back along the cord. 
    At this stage the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> ventral cord processeshave also grown out on
    the right side of the cord (figure 3.4).  However inspection of a
    younger embryo revealed that there was a single continual process
    in the ventral cord at a stage at which <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> processes had not grown
    out (not shown).  In the B reconstruction the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> process grows
    the full length of the cord and up out of the pre-anal ganglion
    into the dorso-rectal ganglion, where it stops by the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> cell
    body.  IT reaches no further than the DRG in all the latter
    embryonic reconstructions (B to D), although in the adult it is
    seen to extend right back into the tail spike (White <i>et al.</i>,
    1986).  Therefore there must be a second period of extension
    postembryonically or during late embryogenesis.</p>
    
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc3.4">
3.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Motor neurons</H3>
    <p class=boxed>The next event after the appearance of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> is the growth of
    processes from the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> motor neurons forward alongside the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>
    process on the right side of the ventral cord.  In the A
    reconstruction these extend until they nearly touch the next <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a>
    cell body (figure 3.4).  In the adult, adjacent <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> neurons overlap
    for a short stretch and are linked by gap junctions, but in all
    the embryonic reconstructions there are small spaces between them
    of the order of a micron in length (figures 3.4, 3.5).  It is of
    course possible that contact has been made and the processes
    subsequently withdrawn.  Another possible correlate of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a>
    extension in the ventral cord, discussed further later, is that
    all the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> ends of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> processes are by <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cell bodies.  Ventral
    cord processes from the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> motor neurons do not grow out
    until later, after the commissures and dorsal cord processes are
    made.  <br><br>The first signs of commissure outgrowth can also be
    seen in the A reconstruction.  All the motor neurons have lamellar
    extensions poking laterally under the ventral musculature at the
    site where their commissural growth cones will leave the ventral
    cord (figure 3.4).  These nascent growth cones leave from the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a>
    and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cell bodies, and from near the anterior end of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> axons. 
    Outgrowth of commissures from the motor neurons of all classes is
    synchronous; in the B series, only about 20 minutes older than the
    A series, they have all reached the lateral hypodermis, and in the
    C series they are just about to reach the dorsal hypodermal ridge
    (figure 3.4).  <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RID;class=Cell">RID</a>, the only process to grow along the full length
    of the dorsal cord, is not present at this time, and the
    commissures apparently turn of their own accord, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> ones
    anteriorly, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> posteriorly, and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> in both directions, and link up
    to form the dorsal cord.  Although they are reproducible, there is
    no regular anterior/posterior order to the positions of the
    commissures from the different classes of cells (figures 1.3,
    3.5), so the direction in which they turn cannot be simply
    determined on the basis of the classes of neighbouring processes
    (e.g. <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a>'s and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a>'s towards each other).  Since the dorsal
    hypodermis is syncytial and does not contain apparent landmarks it
    seems that the direction must be intrinsically determined.  In
    addition, if we assume that the direction is determined in the
    same fashion for all the members of a class, then it must be
    specified in terms of the anterior and posterior of the animal,
    rather than whether to turn left or right, since some of the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a>
    axons go round the left hand side of the body and turn right when
    they reach the dorsal midline, while others go round the right
    side and turn left.  </p>

    There appears to be a possible correlation between the position of <a 
    class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> 
    commissures and the location of hypodermal cell boundaries.  The embryonic 
    ventral hypodermis consists of 6 left/right pairs of cells, known as P 
    cells, which are joined at front and back to the main body hypodermal 
    syncytium, called hyp7. <a class=cell

    lie on the boundaries between adjacent P cells, and they send solitary 
    commissures to the left directly from their cell bodies out along the P/P 
    cell boundary.  In contrast <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DA2;class=Cell">DA2</a>, 
    which is on the boundary between the most anterior P cells and hyp7, sends

    none of which are near a P/P cell boundary, send their commissures together

    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD2;class=Cell">DD2</a> 
    cell body, but opposite <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB4;class=Cell">DB4</a>). 
     It is hard to tell whether a <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> commissure is 
    created by diversion of the growth cone that generated the ventral cord 
    process, or by a genuine branching. The commissure always comes from near 
    the anterior tip of the ventral cord process, the extension of which is 
    essentially complete when the commissure starts growing, suggesting that 
    only a single growth cone is used.  However there is a definite T junction 
    in the final structure, and the <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> process can make 
    branches, since one is certainly made when the commissure reaches the 
    dorsal cord (figure 1.3).  The side of the animal that the <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> commissures go round 
    is easier to explain.  They all go round the right side of the animal, 
    which is consistent with the position on the right side of the cord of 
    their ventral cord processes, from which the commissures diverge or branch.  
    <br>
    <br>
    It is only after the dorsal cord processes have extended for some distance 
    that we begin to see growth of the ventral cord dendrites from <a 
    class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> and <a 
    class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> neurons, 
    (D reconsruction, figure 3.4).  This coincides with the growth back along 
    the cord of some of the ring interneurons, possibley including the motor 
    circuitry interneurons that innervate the <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> and <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> ventral cord 
    processes.  However there are no visible synaptic connections between the 
    interneurons and the growing <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> and <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> dendrites.  <br>
    <br>
    The dorsal cord, in the other hand, does show signs of synaptic activity in 
    the D reconstruction.  The <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> and <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> neurons are already 
    making small, but clear, neuromuscular junctions from their dorsal cord 
    axons (figure 3.6).  As in the final adult version these involve a joint 
    synapse onto muscle and a <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> process.  No 
    corresponding <a class=cell 
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> neuromuscular 
    junctions in the ventral cord have been seen in this reconstruction.  The 
    dorsal cord processes have not reached their final length in the D 
    reconstruction, and in fact are at a rather interesting stage: each <a 
    class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DA</a> axon 
    stops where the next one arrives at the dorsal cord and turns.  Later the 
    axons overlap considerably, but the regions of neuromuscular output do not; 
    instead they correspond closely to the regions where the axons are present 
    at this stage.  It is possible to speculate that there is a pause in axon 
    extension while the zones of neuromuscular activity are being set up, but 
    more data would be required to provide respectable evidence!

   <p class=boxed>
   While the motor neuron commissures are growing out, a set of interneurons 
   are growing forward along the ventral cord from the pre-anal ganglion (PAG) 
   at the back (figure 3.5).  The most advanced of these are two pairs of 
   processes, <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
   and PVQL on the left side of the ventral cord and <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
   and PVQR on the right side. These are followed by <a class=cell

   and <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a>, 
   which are both unpaired neurons that run on the right.  Figure 3.7 shows a 
   cross section of the posterior cord from the C reconstruction, after these 
   posterior neurons have reached the front of the cord, that we see other 
   anterior interneurons growing back along the cord (figure 3.4). <a

   neurons are the most anterior cells in the lumbar ganglia (PVQL in the left

   PVQL and <a class=cell

   pioneer the left hand ventral cord; this appears to be a joint action, 
   since their anterior tips are never more than a few tenths of a micron 
   apart in any of the reconstructions (e.g. figure 3.5).  The tips of the 
   PVQR and <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
   are similarly close to each other, but there is no such tight relationship 
   between the left hand pair and the right hand pair (figure 3.5).  The fact 
   that the left hand pair are often more advanced than the right hand pair 
   suggests that the prior presence of <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
   and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> 
   processes on the right side of the cord has little effect on <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
   and PVQR outgrowth.  The two processes in each pair are tightly associated 
   all the way along the cord back to the point where the <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
   class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
   processes cross over in the PAG. This association is also seen in the adult 
   reconstructions of the ventral cord; the processes diverge only when they 
   reach the nerve ring (White <i>et al.</i>, 1986, unpublished data).  
   Together these observations suggest that <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a

   on the other hand, grows down the left side of the rectum and crosses from

   nor <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
   appear to be particularly tightly associated with any other process in the 
   ventral cord.  In the adult cord <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVA;class=Cell">DVA</a> 
   is always at the ventral right hand exremity of the main right hand bundle, 
   whilst <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
   runs in the middle of the bundle, in association with DVB, which is the

   eventually grow the full length of the cord; the others stop at the front 
   of the pre-anal ganglion.  There is a very characteristic pattern at the 
   back of the pre-anal ganglion where the lumbar processes from the two sides 
   meet, which has been seen whenever the region has been reconstructed 
   (figure 3.9).  The processes from each side meet slightly to the right of 
   the midline and "zip up", each contacting its contralateral analogue.  The

   class=cell

   are the only lumbar processes to run up the cord with one process on each 
   side of the cord, as opposed to the more normal pattern of both processes 
   being on the right.  Anterior interneurons: Anterior interneurons other 
   than the <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
   are only seen growing back along the cord in the D reconstruction.  As 
   described in the section on cell identification in Chapter 2 it is not 
   possible to identify these processes.  However it is clear that there are 
   at least <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
   and PVQL on the left side.  There is one is one process growing part way

   or <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a>, 
   and there are 11 interneurons on the right, some of which probably come 
   from the back (e.g. <a class=cell 
   href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
   and PVQR), but others of which are from the front; in particular 4 from the 
   front stop within the anterior D reconstruction.  The anterior interneurons 
   seen her may include (some of) the major interneurons that innervate the 
   ventral cord motor neurons.

    <p class=boxed>The <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> processes cross over in the pre-anal ganglion where
    they leave their cell bodies and then grow forward on the opposite
    side of the cord.  This crossing over is at the back of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVT;class=Cell">PVT</a> and

    left to right.  PVQL, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> and, to a lesser extent, PVQR flatten
    out on the surface of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a>; <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> is always between the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> crossover
    and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a> (figure 3.8).  The <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> cross over was observed in the
    adult reconstruction (White et al, 1986), but it is much less
    clear there since there are extra cells in the adult preanal
    ganglion (6 postembryonic motor neurons) and the arrangement of
    cells and processes is much less well organised.  This loss of
    symmetry and order is already visible in the difference between
    the B and D reconstructions.  In the B reconstruction the cells in
    the left/right pairs (<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DA8;class=Cell">DA8</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DA9;class=Cell">DA9</a>) are nearly opposite one
    another, while in the D reconstruction there is a definite tilt to
    each pair and the whole preanal ganglion is becoming more linear. 
    This is probably caused by a lateral constriction due to
    elongation of the embryo and an increase in the amount of space
    taken up by the muscle cells as they mature.  In the adult the
    symmetry and order present in the early embryo when processes
    first grow out is almost entirely lost.</p>

    <p class=boxed>A phenomenon equivalent to the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> crossover is seen in the
    retrovesicular ganglion at the front of the ventral cord, which is
    once again more symmetrical in the embryo than in the adult. 
    There are three bilateral pairs of neurons in the embryonic
    retrovesicular ganglion: <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIGL;class=Cell">RIGL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIGR;class=Cell">RIGR</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFL;class=Cell">RIFL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFR;class=Cell">RIFR</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SABVL;class=Cell">SABVL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=SABVR;class=Cell">SABVR</a>, all of whose
    processes run forward.  The <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFL;class=Cell">RIFL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFR;class=Cell">RIFR</a> processes have grown out in the A
    and B reconstructions and once again they are seen to cross over
    by their cell bodies (figure 3.10).  Following this observation,
    careful comparison of the positions of cell bodies in embryonic
    reconstructions and the embryonic lineage study (Sulston <i>et al.</i>,
    1983) with those in the adult reconstructions (White <i>et al.</i>, 1986)
    confirmed that the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFL;class=Cell">RIFL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIFR;class=Cell">RIFR</a> processes did indeed cross over in the
    adult reconstructions, and that the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIG;class=Cell">RIG</a> and SABV processes do the
    same.  The Processes from all three classes cross in nearly the
    same place in the adult reconstruction, by the SABV cell bodies. 
    The SABV processes are just beginning to grow out and cross in the
    B reconstruction (figure 3.10), but the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIG;class=Cell">RIG</a> processes have not yet
    grown out.  <br><br>Therefore crossing over is seen in all the
    embryonic left/right pairs of interneurons in what might be termed
    the extended ventral cord, i.e. everything on the ventral
    hypodermal ridge between the excretory duct and the anus.  During
    postembryonic development another interneuron pair, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVFL;class=Cell">AVFL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVFR;class=Cell">AVFR</a>, is
    added in the retrovesicular ganglion, but their processes are not
    bilaterally symmetrical; they are bipolar, running back together
    down the right side of the ventral cord and forward also together
    to the left of the excretory duct and round the left side of the
    nerve ring.  <br><br>The crossing over, or decussation, of
    processes to the opposite side of the body from the soma is a
    property of many nerve types in higher animals, and the cases
    observed here may provide extremely simple examples of the same
    event that are susceptible to experimental manipulation of both
    the cells involved and of their environment.  Several cell
    ablation experiments were performed to investigate factors
    involved in the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> cross over in the preanal ganglion (Chapter
    4).</p>
    
    <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc3.7"> 3.7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth cone insertions into 
    other cells</H3>
    
    <p class=boxed>
    An observation previously made in other animals is the insertion of thin 
    processes from growth cones into other neuronal processes or target tissues 
    that might be important for guidance (Bastiani and Goodman, 1983).  The 
    same phenomeno9n has been observed in the developing <i>C. elegans</i>  
    nervous system, and there are two cases in particular where it is 
    especially noticeable and correlates with possible guidance decision 
    taking.  <br>
    <br>
    The first case is when the motor neuron commissures reach the dorsal 
    midline.  In one reconstruction (wild type but not on of A to D), a single 
    commissure has just reached the dorsal hypodermal ridge, on emerging from 
    underneath the left dorsal muscle quadrant.  The growing tip of this 
    commissure inserts two stubby finger-like processes about 0.1  0.2 microns 
    in diameter and 0.4  0.8 microns long into the dorsal hypodermal ridge 
    (figure 3.11).  It is at this stage that the growth cone must turn through 
    a right angle and grow along the ridge.

    quadrant.  The particles to the left of the finger are not vesicles 
    (determined by viewing at higher resolution).

    <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cell bodies.  In all cases that have been reconstructed the

    respectively.  Insertion of <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD4;class=Cell">DD4</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD3;class=Cell">DD3</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD2;class=Cell">DD2</a> into <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB5;class=Cell">DB5</a>, <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB4;class=Cell">DB4</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB3;class=Cell">DB3</a>
    also takes place but less frequently and in a less pronounced

    3.12).  These <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> insertions into <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cells reinforce the suggestion
    made above that <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a> cells might be involved in <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> morphology. 
    Where the insertions are most pronounced (<a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB6;class=Cell">DB6</a> and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB7;class=Cell">DB7</a>), the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DB</a>
    commissures grow to the right next to the <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree">DD</a> commissures.  <br><br>
    There are occasional other insertions into the ventral hypodermis
    from growth cones of processes growing along the ventral cord
    (data not shown), but no particular pattern is discernible.  Also
    I have seen no cytological correlates of the insertions, such as
    vesicles clustering around the insertion in the cell into which
    the insertion is made, which have been seen in the corresponding
    phenomenon in insects (Bastiani and Goodman, 1983).  </p>
