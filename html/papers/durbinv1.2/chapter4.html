4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Laser Ablation Experiments</H2>
    <p class=boxed>The previous chapter described a times series of 
embryonic
    reconstructions that allowed a picture to be drawn of the course
    of normal nerve outgrowth in and around the ventral nerve cord. 
    This chapter describes a set of cell ablation experiments in which
    chosen cells were removed by ablating their parents with a
    focussed laser beam, using a system developed by J. G. White
    (Sulston and White, 1980).  Chapter 2 describes the protocol used. 
    The advantage of killing the parent cell is not only that it
    unequivocally prevents production of the cell of interest, but
    also that the remains of the dead cell are excluded from the
    embryo when the ventral hypodermis closes up, removing them also
    from any possible influence.  The chapter is organised with a
    section for each set of experiments.</p>

is the first process to grow along the ventral cord
    (Chapter 3).  It grows back along the right hand side, and later
    the adult cord is remarkably asymmetrical, with over 90% of its
    processes on the right hand side (there are 3 to 5 on the left,
    depending on anterior/posterior position, as against about 50 on
    the right).  To what degree is <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
involved in establishing this
    asymmetry, and which cells, if any, depend directly on <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
to
    correctly determine the positioning of their processes?  To answer
    these questions I removed <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
by ablating its parent cell,
    Abprpapppa.  The sister of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, 
which is also removed by this
    ablation, is <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=RIR;class=Cell">RIR</a>, 
a ring interneuron whose cell body and processes
    all lie some distance anterior to those of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, 
and whose synaptic
    connections in the adult are not closely related to ventral cord
    circuitry (White <i>et al.</i>, 1986).  <br><br>Nine experimental 
animals
    were permitted to develop and hatch in order to test whether motor
    control was affected, a crude test of ventral cord function.  Six
    of these showed a very mild uncoordinated phenotype as newly
    hatched L1 larvae, in some cases only clearly visible when the
    worm was made to swim in water, in which case sections of their
    thrashing bodies looked stiffer than normal.  Those worms that
    were uncoordinated as larvae were similarly uncoordinated as
    adults.  <br><br>One of the adults showing an uncoordinated
    phenotype was sectioned through the front part of the ventral cord
    and the retrovesicular ganglion.  Eileen Southgate reconstructed
    this series, since she and John White were interested in another
    question, concerning regulation in the circuitry.  <br><br>The
    reconstruction confirmed that <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
was absent sine: (1) there were
    one too few cells in the RVG, and (ii) there were only two cells
    in the RVG with posteriorly directed processes that extended back
    through the complete series (<a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVFL;class=Cell">AVFL</a> 
and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVFR;class=Cell">AVFR</a>, 
they and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
are the
    only ventral cord interneurons in the RVG).  Almost all the cells
    in the RVG were identifiable, but there were some ambiguities
    concerning motor neuron identification both here and in the
    anterior ventral cord.  This is because the spatial organisation
    of many nerve processes, especially those belonging to motor
    neurons, was abnormal.  Cell body positions tended to be slightly
    displaced from normal, but the general order was preserved.  </p>

    <p class=boxed>The most striking aspect of the process bundle
    disorganisation can be seen in a random cross section of the cord
    behind the RVG (figure 4.1): instead of a large bundle of about 50
    processes on the right and one of 4 or 5 on the left there are
    several smaller bundles, including two on the left hand side. 
    There is no fixed arrangement of these small bundles as one
    progresses along the cord: processes occasionally transfer between
    bundles, and sometimes bundles fuse to form a larger grouping or
    split to form two smaller ones.  However there are always
    significantly more processes on the right than on the left.  The
    total number of processes appears normal (this comparison can only
    be made approximately, since the number of motor neuron processes
    present at any particular point is variable).  <br><br>Several of
    the motor neurons are disrupted.  These are motor neuron cell
    bodies associated with both sides of the cord (<a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=VD2;class=Cell">VD2</a> 
and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB3;class=Cell">DB3</a> 
are to
    the left), and also motor neuron processes on both sides (all of
    <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=VD3;class=Cell">VD3</a> 
and parts of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB3;class=Cell">DB3</a>, 
<a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=VD2;class=Cell">VD2</a> 
and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=VB2;class=Cell">VB2</a> 
processes are on the left).  In
    addition <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB3;class=Cell">DB3</a> 
is lacking a commissure, and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD2;class=Cell">DD2</a>'s 
commissure is
    severley misplaced or missing (the <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD2;class=Cell">DD2</a> 
cell body is off the
    posterior end of the reconstruction, but its commissure should
    come out from the cord with that of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DA2;class=Cell">DA2</a>, 
some 150 sections
    anterior to the end of the series).  Instead of a commissure, the
    <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB3;class=Cell">DB3</a> 
process has a branch that crosses to the left hand side and
    shows some characteristics of the normal dorsal branch, in that
    first it runs backwards from the crossover point, and second it
    contains three neuromuscular junctions (figure 4.1).  Normally all
    ventral cord neuromuscular activity is from the right hand cord,
    and all <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB3;class=Cell">DB3</a>'s 
neuromuscula routput is from its backward dorsal
    branch.  <br><br>Many of the interneuron processes cannot be
    identified because they make no synapses and their cell bodies are
    outside the bounds of the reconstruction.  Among those that can
    are the two <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVFL;class=Cell">AVFL</a>/<a 
class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVFR;class=Cell">AVFR</a> 
neurons, which have cell bodies in the RVG, and
    which both send their processes back down the left hand cord in
    this recosntruction, as opposed to the right normally (figure
    4.1).  It is also possible to identify the 8 main motor circuitry
    interneurons by class (2 each of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVAL;class=Cell">AVAL</a>/<a 
class=cell

and the 4 <a class=cell

neurons, figure 4.1), because of their patterns of synaptic output
    and gap junction formation with the motor neurons.  In most cases
    where they are accessible to the motor neurons the normal synaptic
    connections are made.  Normally these motor circuitry interneurons
    run in the central left side of the main (right hand) ventral
    cord, with a regular internal order: <a class=cell

loosely sandwiched in between.  In
    this reconstruction they all keep together in the main right hand
    bundle, and amongst themselves they roughly preserve their normal
    order, but the whole group is often displaced from its regular
    position and orientation (figure 4.1).  Thus it appears that, as a
    group, their internal organisation remains, but that they have
    lost the external cues that give the group as a whole a fixed
    position relative to other processes, some of which, indeed, are
    separated by being in other bundles.  <br><br>In addition to this
    adult reconstruction I also looked at an embryo in which the
    parent of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
had ablated, fixing it at the stage when the motor
    neuron commissures are normally just growing out from the ventral
    cord (around 500 minutes).  In this case I recosntructed the back
    part of the ventral cord and also the preanal ganglion (PAG).  </p>

was both correctly identified and correctly removed.  The positions where

    <p class=boxed>Although the <a class=cell

process was clearly missing, there was no
    other alteration to the organisation of the PAG and the early
    posterior interneurons that grow forward along the cord from it
    (the <a class=cell

every process following its normal
    trajectory.  However, as in the adult, the ventral cord was
    disorganised.  In this case the most posterior three motor neurons
    (<a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a>, 
<a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DA7;class=Cell">DA7</a> 
and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB7;class=Cell">DB7</a>) 
looked normal, but <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD5;class=Cell">DD5</a>'s 
anterior process in
    the ventral cord, although leaving the cell body on the right side
    as normal, switched sides from right to left and sent out its
    commissure on the left.  <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB6;class=Cell">DB6</a>, 
whose commissure usually goes to the
    right with that of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD5;class=Cell">DD5</a>, 
sent it s commissure to the left also. 
    <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DA6;class=Cell">DA6</a>'s 
commissure, which is usually on the left, went to the right
    instead (figure 4.2).  <br><br>In summary, it seems that, in the
    absence of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>, 
the motor neurons in the ventral cord are variably
    disorganised in terms of process growth.  Some examples look
    normal, while others send processes on the wrong side of the cord,
    or fail to form commissures, etc.  This applies to both embryonic
    and postembryonic motor neuron classes, although the postembryonic
    neurons look much less affected.  A second, possibly related,
    consequence of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
removal is a splitting of the ventral cord into
    several bundles, some of which are on the left hand side of the
    cord.  Some interneurons are also split off into these alternative
    bundles, but in the adult example that was reconstructed the main
    motor circuitry interneurons look fairly normal.  Many of the
    motor neurons are able to make correct synaptic contact both with
    their innervating interneurons and with muscle.  This probably
    explains why the observed behavioural phenotype of removing <a 
class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>
    was only minor uncoordination, when a difference was noticeable at
    all.  </p>

    However since this is a young embryo (approx. 175 minutes) one cannot 
say 
    if the gap will be filled later.

    the ventral cord next to <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a>. 
These processes grow forward until
    they meet or almost meet the next <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>DD</a> in the sequence (in 
the
    various wild type embryonic series they were often separated by a
    gap of about 1 micron, Chapter 3).  Then commissures grow out to
    the right from near their front tips.  By removing a <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>DD</a> cell and
    examining whether the processes would extend further along the
    cord to fill in the gap, I was able to test whether process growth
    is terminated solely by contact, and if so, whether the position
    of the commissure also changed.  Does it always leave from the
    front of the ventral cord process?  <br><br>In fact it was easy to
    remove <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD3;class=Cell">DD3</a> 
and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD5;class=Cell">DD5</a> 
together, creating two gaps in a single animal,
    since they are sisters.  As with <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
it was checked that their
    dead parent (Abplppappp) was excluded from the embryo after laser
    ablation, and that the relevant <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>DD</a> cell was missing in 
the
    subsequent reconstruction.  <br><br>I have reconstructed the front
    part of one embryo from the seven that were fixed and sectioned. 
    In this animal, which is the same age as the wild type A series
    (around 480 minutes), the gap left by removing <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD3;class=Cell">DD3</a> 
has not been
    filled by <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD4;class=Cell">DD4</a>.  
Instead the <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD4;class=Cell">DD4</a> 
process stops at the front of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB5;class=Cell">DB5</a>,
    
only very slightly further forward, if at all, than normal (figure
    4.3).  There is a short posterior extension from <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD2;class=Cell">DD2</a>, 
which is not
    unusual (figure 3.5), but this stops around <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DB4;class=Cell">DB4</a>, 
leaving a gap
    with no <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>DD</a> processes along the 
whole extent of the <a class=cell

neurons.  To summarise briefly: these form the first group of interneurons 
    to grow forward from the back of the ventral cord. The <a class=cell

cell bodies are in the lumbar ganglia; they send processes down the lumbar 
    commissures through the preanal ganglion (PAG), wheter they pick up 
contact 
    with the <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a

bodies lie in the PAG; their processes leave their bodies heading towards 
    the midline, cross over, and then grow forward on the opposite side of 
the 
    ventral cord.  So <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
runs with PVQL on the left hand side, while <a class=cell

a block of fixed experimental embryos was completely sectioned for each of 
    the sets of ablations (7 embryos for <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a>, 
    
5 for <a class=cell

and 5 for PVQL).  In addition 5 adult <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
experimental animals were cut at 3 random sites in the posterior half of 
    the cord to help answer the second question.  Again the parent cell 
was 
    ablated in each case and only embryos that excluded the dead cell on 
    closure of the hypodermis were considered further.  In the case of 
PVQL the 
    parent is Abplapppa and the sister cell normally undergoes programmed 
cell 
    death and engulfment soon after being born; therefore there is no 
    additional cell missing in experimental animals at the time of process 
    outgrowth.  The sisters of <a class=cell

href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AB.prppppa;class=Cell">AB.prppppa</a>) 
    
are left and right ventral rectal epithelial cells (repVR and repVL).  
    Together with repD these form a ring of rectal cells that lie above 
and 
    forward of the PAG; they are sufficiently distant to be unlikely to be 
    important in nerve process guidance in the PAG. In the reconstructions 
of 
    <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
and <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
    
experimental embryos the correct repV cell was seen to be missing; in each 
    case the rectum had resealed by extension forward of one of the 
posterior 
    neighbouring pair of rectal epithelial cells (K and K') rather than 
    circumferential filling in by the other rep cells.<br>
    I will consider the four questions posed in above in turn:<br>
    <br>
    1. It is easier to observe the presence or absence of <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
    
class=cell

class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a>/<a 
    
class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> 
    
processes on the left side of the cord (<a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
and PVQL) than on the right side, since during the stages under 
    consideration those are the only nerve processes on the left side.  I 
first 
    considered the embryos in which <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
had been removed.  Of the four embroyos in which it was possible to 
    identify a region of the ventral cord anterior to PAG where the <a 
    class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
    
and PVQR processes were visible on the right side of the cord, none had 
any 
    processes on the left side (figure 4.4).  The PAG and posterior cord 
of one 
    of these embryos was reconstructed; in this case PVQL grew forward as 
    normal through left side of the PAG past the point where it would 
normally 
    have picked up contact with <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
and then, at the front of <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a>, 
    
which was displaced slightly anterior to its normal position, it switched 
    sides from left to right and ran forward for a short distance with <a 
    class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
    
and PVQR (figure 4.5).  Its anterior tip, however, was more than 2.5 
    microns posterior to the tips of <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
    
and PVQR (which were off the anterior end of the series, 54 sections from 
    the PVQL tip).  Therefore it appears that <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
is necessary for growth of PVQL along the left side of the cord, and that 
    in its absence PVQL is retarded somewhat, but grows forward along the 
    established path of <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
    
and PVQR. <br>
    <br>
    However, when PVPRL (erratum in the manuscript)  was removed, in each 
of 
    the three embryos for which the same region anterior to the PAG was 
    identified, a solitary process was seen on the left side (figure 
4.4).  The 
    PAG region of two of these embryos was reconstructed; in each case 
PVQL was 
    missing and <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
grew as normal along the left side of the cord.  In the younger of the 
    series (about 470 minutes) it stopped about 1.7 microns (34 sections) 
    posteriorly to the point where the <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/PVQR 
    
processes on the right stopped; the older series did not contain the 
    anterior tips of any of the processes.  Therefore, in contrast to 
PVQL, it 
    appears that <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
is competent to grow by itself to the left side of the cord.  <br>
    <br>
    Finally, I considered the consequences of removing <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>, 
    
the bilaterally homologous experiment to that of removing <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a>. 
    
In this case PVQR stayed on the right side, rather than crossing to join 
<a 
    class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
and PVQL (two animals: one was reconstructed completely and one animal had 
    two long processes but no third process in the left cord, even near 
the 
    PAG, figures 4.4, 4.5).  However it must be remembered that, in the 
absence 
    of PVQL when PVQR was removed, since event though the <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
    
process is absent on the right side of the cord there are still <a 
    class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
    
and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>DD</a> 
    processes there, whilst when <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
was removed there was nothing on the left side.  The corresponding 
    reciprocal experiment of removing PVQR was not attempted, since it 
seemed 
    unlikely that there would be an effect in the more populated right 
hand 
    side of the cord, where there had been none when PVQL was removed on 
the 
    left side.  <br>
    <br>
    In summary, <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
is necessary for growth of PVQL on the left side of the cord.  In its 
    absence PVQL grows on the right side.  However <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
    
is not necessary for PVQR to grow on the right side, presumably because 
    PVQR can follow the preexisting <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVG;class=Cell">AVG</a> 
    
and <a class=cell href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/pedigree>DD</a> 
    processes there.  In contrast, the removal of PVQL has no significant 
    effect on <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a>. 
    
<BR>
    2. To answer the question of whether <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
and PVQL are needed for growth of other processes down the left cord, I 
    ablated the patent of <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
in six animals and looked at the left side of the adult, rather than the 
    embryonic, so that all processes would have had the opportunity to 
complete 
    growth. The fixed animals were cut at three random sites in the 
posterior 
    half of the body, where <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a> 
    
is normally present on the left side together with <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
and PVQL. One of the five animals was rejected because of poor fixation.  
    None of the remaining five had any consistent process showing on the 
left 
    side of the cord (figure 4.4).  In several cases there appeared to be 
a 
    process visible at one of the sites.  This was probably a fold or 
finger of 
    hypodermis; such hypodermal extensions are common around the adult 
ventral 
    cord (for example there are two in the section from the control 
    reconstruction in figure 4.1).  Therefore both <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>, 
    
as expected from the previous result, and <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a> 
    
were missing from the left side in all five cases, implying that the <a 
    class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a>/PVQL 
    
pair is necessary for <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a> 
    
to grow down the left hand ventral cord.  It is not possible to ascertain 
    whether <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=AVKR;class=Cell">AVKR</a> 
    
had switched to the right side of the cord in the experimental animals, or 
    had failed to grow back at all, without reconstruction of the complete 
    nerve ring. <BR>
    3. The removal of neither a <a class=cell

nor a <a class=cell

cell affected the crossing over the opposite side of the <a class=cell

class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
processes when they leave their cell bodies in the centre of the preanal 
    ganglion (figure 4.5).  The embryonic PAG reconstructions after 
removing 
    either <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
or <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a> 
    
show that the remaining <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
    
class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
cell sent its process across the midline in exactly the same location as 
    usual.  This rules out an explanation of the chiasm being caused by 
mutual 
    attraction of <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
    
class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
    
processes. The reconstructions after PVQL parent ablations also showed no 
    change. <BR>
    4. However there did appear to be an effect on the left lumbar 
commissure 
    when PVQL was removed.  In neither of the two experimental animals 
that 
    were reconstructed did any other processes come down the left lumbar 
    commissure into the PAG, although in each case the <a class=cell 
    
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DA8;class=Cell">DA8</a> 
    
process had already grown dorsally via the same path out of the PAG. One 
of 
    the reconstructed animals was young enough that the following 
processes on 
    the right side had only just passed through the commissure; however in 
the 
    second four of the right hand lumbar processes other than PVQR had 
grown 
    half way through the PAG (figure 4.6).

    <p class=boxed>One further ablation experiment was tried in an attempt 
to
    understand why the <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
processes cross over in the preanal
    ganglion.  As described in Chapter 3, at the point where the
    crossover takes place the process of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
spreads out into a thin
    sheet that separates the cell bodies of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVT;class=Cell">PVT</a> 
and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a>; 
the <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a>
    
processes actually cross between <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVT;class=Cell">PVT</a> 
and the <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
sheet.  It
    therefore seemed possible that <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
was essential for the
    crossover.  Therefore five embryos were fixed in which the parent
    of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
had been ablated, two of which were later reconstructed in
    the region of the PAG. <br><br>The sister of <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
(parent Caapa)
    normally undergoes programmed cell death before differentiating
    and so is unlikely to be required for the development of the PAG.
    Since the <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
parent lies underneath the tail hypodermal cells at
    the time of its ablation it is not excluded from the embryo as in
    all other cases.  However I checked that condensed nuclear debris
    was visible about 20 minutes after the ablations, and the absence
    of the <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a> 
cell body was confirmed in the two reconstructed
    embryos.  <br><br>No effect was seen on the <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a> 
crossover in either
    reconstruction.  Instead <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQR;class=Cell">PVQR</a> 
and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVQL;class=Cell">PVQL</a> 
flattened out somewhat and
    met in the centre, partially replacing <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DVC;class=Cell">DVC</a>'s 
role in separating
    <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVT;class=Cell">PVT</a> 
and the crossing over <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPL;class=Cell">PVPL</a>/<a 
class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=PVPR;class=Cell">PVPR</a>'s 
from <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a> 
(figure 4.7).  This
    possibly suggests that PVQL, PVQR and <a class=cell 
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/cell/cell.cgi?name=DD6;class=Cell">DD6</a> 
have somewhat
    interchangeable or redundant functions at this point in organising
    the PAG. However the multiple ablations which might test this
    suggestions have not yet been attempted.  </p>
