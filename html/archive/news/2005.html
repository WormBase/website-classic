      <li><b>August 21, 2005: First published reference of C. elegans</b><br>
        The first <a href="/papers/1900-maupas/index.html">published reference<a/> to C. elegans -- the paper that describes
        C. elegans as a new species -- is now available at WormBase [<a href="/papers/1900-maupas/Maupas_1900.pdf">PDF</a>].
        This translation and an accompanying foreword [<a href="/papers/1900-maupas/Maupas_foreword.pdf">PDF</a>,

         A <a href="ftp://caltech.wormbase.org/pub/annots/rnai/">mapping table</a>
         of Julie Ahringer RNAi clones to current predicted genes is now available in a flat file format.
         The Ahringer RNAi feeding library uses GenePairs names to label
         bacterial strains. GenePairs names usually, but not always correspond
         to predicted C. elegans gene names. The mapping file reconciles these discrepancies and also
         contains some additional information including clone plate location,
         clone error report status and type of affected gene. The file is
         synchronized with the current live release to provide up-to-date
         mapping information. A link to the mapping file can be found in the
         Worm Reagents section of the main page (listed as RNAi clone mapping).

<!--     <li><b>July 14, 2005: Some Concise Description attributions missing</b><br>
         Due to a technical error, the Concise Descriptions that appear at the top
         of the Gene Summary pages have lost paper evidence attribution from worm
         meeting abstracts and from Worm Breeder's Gazette articles.  Please be aware
         that some of these descriptions contain data that was extracted from these
         sources, in addition to the published literature that remains listed as
         evidence.  Proper attribution will soon be restored to the development site and
         the live site.  WormBase apologizes for the error.
