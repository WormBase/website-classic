          <li><b>December 24, 2004: WormBase features described in new publication</b><br>
             New features to WormBase are described in a new manuscript
             "WormBase: a comprehensive data resource for Caenorhabditis
             biology and genomics, Chen et al." appearing this month in the annual <a
             href="http://nar.oupjournals.org/content/vol33/suppl_1/">Nucleic
             Acids Research Database issue</a>.  Access to the <a
             href="http://nar.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/33/suppl_1/D383">full
             text</a> is free.
	  <li><b>December 24, 2004: New release of WormBase, WS136</b><br>
	    WormBase has been updated to the WS136 release of the
	    database.  This is the final data release for 2004.  This
	    release includes a new <a
	    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene_class">Gene
	    Class</a> display.  This display makes it easy to see, for
	    example, all genes that fall into the <a
	    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/gene_class?name=lin">lin</a>
	    class (as well as genes previously included in this
	    class).
	  <li><b>December 26, 2004: Textpresso server is back on-line</b><br>
   	    Service to the Textpresso server (which powers literature
   	    searches at WormBase) has been restored.  We apologize for
   	    any inconvenience this outtage may have caused.
	  <li class="warning"><b>December 24, 2004:  Textpresso server temporarily unavailable</b><br>
	    Due to technical difficulties, literature searches via
	    Textpresso are temporarily unavailable.  We are working on
	    the problem and hope to have it resolved shortly. Posted
	    12.21.2004.
	  <li><b>December 5, 2004: Initial batch of BCGSC GFP expression patterns available</b><br>
	    The first set of GFP constructs and expression patterns
	    from the <a
	    href="http://elegans.bcgsc.ca/home/ge_consortium.html">BC
	    C. elegans Gene Expression Consortium</a> is now
	    available. This set spans over 300 images with more images
	    to be added to WormBase over the coming months.  The
	    Consortium is supported by funding from Genome BC / Genome
	    Canada.  See the expression pattern of <a
	    href="/db/gene/expression?name=xnp-1">xnp-1</a> for an
	    example.
	  <li><b>December 5, 2004: New release of WormBase, WS135</b><br>
 	    WormBase has been updated to the WS135 release of the
 	    database. New features include manually curated binding
 	    sites (visible on the <a
 	    href="/db/seq/gbrowse/wormbase?name=I%3A10259034..10269033;source=wormbase;width=800;version=100;label=LOCI%3Aoverview-CG-OP-SeqFeature-GB">Genome
 	    Browser</a>). In addition, WormBase has been updated to
 	    the most recent release of the Uniprot database.
	  <li><b>November 12, 2004: New genome-wide RNAi data set based on an ORFeome library available</b><br>
	    The results from the systematic RNAi screen reported in
	    PMID: 15489339, Rual et al., "Toward improving
	    Caenorhabditis elegans phenome mapping with an
	    ORFeome-based RNAi library" are now available. There are
	    10951 experiments, 1066 of which showed a mutant
	    phenotype.  See <a
	    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/rnai?name=MV_SV%3Amv_AAB02615;class=RNAi">MV_SV
	    mv_AAB02615</a> for an example.
	  <li><b>November 12, 2004: Genetic spans now available on the Genome Browser</b><br>
	    To aid in positional cloning, the calculated genetic span
	    of loci with two-factor positions are now displayed on the
	    Genome Browser under the track "Genetic Limits".  See <a
	    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse/wormbase?name=III%3A7502125..7542124;source=wormbase;width=800;version=100;label=LOCI%3Aoverview-CG-OP-GENETIC">III:7,502,125</a>
	    for an example.  Please note that these positions should
	    be treated with some skepticism since they rely on
	    interpolating the genetic map onto the physical map.
	    Please send us your comments on this experimental feature!
	  <li><b>November 12, 2004: New Release Of WormBase, WS134</b><br>
	    WormBase has been updated to the WS134 release of the
	    database. This release contains new RNAi experiments from
	    Rual et al. (2004). The Genome Browser has been enhanced
	    to display alternative splices in UTRs within gene models,
	    along with a new experimental track the displays genetic
	    spans.
	  <li><b>October 30, 2004: New Release Of WormBase, WS133</b><br>
	    WormBase has been updated to the WS133 release of the

	    reciprocal best blast match ortholog pairs between
	    <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>C. briggsae</i> since the initial
	    analysis. For an example, see the Gene Page entry for <a
	    href="/db/gene/gene?name=lin-29">lin-29</a>.
	  <li><b>October 16, 2004: Three Week Release Interval</b><br>

	    releases.	  
	  <li><b>October 12, 2004: New Release Of WormBase, WS132</b><br>
	    WormBase has been updated to the WS132 release of the
	    database.
	  <li><b>October 7, 2004: Genes Now Searchable By Descriptive Terms</b><br> 
	    In addition to searching for genes by name, users may now
	    search using descriptive terms such as <a
	    href="/db/gene/gene?name=inducible">inducible</a>,
	    functional descriptions such as <a
	    href="/db/gene/gene?name=cancer">cancer</a>, or proper
	    names from other model systems such as <a
	    href="/db/gene/gene?name=bicoid">bicoid</a>.  This
	    facility draws from the recently added homology group data
	    as well as manually curated concise descriptions of gene
	    function.
	  <li><b><span class="warning">September 27, 2004: Scheduled Network Outtage</span></b><br>
