<h1>WormBase Logo Contest</h1>

<p>

WormBase announces its first ever contest to select a logo for the web
site.  We are looking for two kinds of logo: a masthead-style banner
to display across the top of the web site, and a small square logo to
use in correspondence, presentations and elsewhere.

<h2>Fabulous Prizes</h2>

<p>

The winner(s) will receive world-wide recognition, their names in
lights, and a WormBase mug and/or tee-shirt.
