<h2>WormBase Presentations at the 14th Biennial International C. elegans Conference, UCLA</h2>


<pre>
A <a href="http://ena.caltech.edu/~eimear/IWM_schedule.html">Schedule</a> prepared by Eimear Kenny, June 16, 2003.


<b>Wormbase Workshop</b>
The WormBase workshop is a forum for community outreach and feedback for
the WormBase database project. The project's PIs and curators will explain
how data gets into the database, how it is maintained, and what you can do
to make additions and corrections to the data. We will review recent
changes to the user interface, and seek your comments, suggestions and
criticisms of all aspects of the project.
