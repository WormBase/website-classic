<p><h1>2001 International Worm Art Show</h1></p>

<img src="yinyang.jpg" align="LEFT" alt="Zen and the Art of the Worm">

<p>The<i> C. elegans</i> community is fortunate to have generated
many wonderful biological images (i.e. fluorescence micrographs) and
artistic renditions of worms and embryos over the years. Those who
have photographed or drawn such images are invited to display them
during the poster sessions.&nbsp; We had an excellent turnout last
international meeting and we expect that there will be even more stiff
competition this year.&nbsp; Prizes will be awarded.</p>
