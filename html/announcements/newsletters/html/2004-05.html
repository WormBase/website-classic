    <h2>WormBase Newsletter #5, May 2004</h2>

    <h3>Using WormBase for bioinformatics</h3>
    <p><img width=148 height=141 src="images/image002.jpg" align=left hspace=16>

      <b>Version freezes:</b> We would like to remind our users that
      WormBase offers version freezes.  Every tenth release is
      available, so that bioinformaticians can refer to and work with
      a particular version of the <i>C. elegans</i> genome (eg., <a
      href="http://ws120.wormbase.org/">http://ws120.wormbase.org</a>).  If you need to refer to WormBase in
      a publication, please refer to one of the freeze
      versions.</p>
    <p><b>Linking and Mining WormBase:</b></p>
    <p>
      A powerful aceserver (<a
      href="http://aceserver.cshl.org/">aceserver.cshl.org</a>) has
      been set up and can be remotely accessed via command-line and
      scripts. It is easy to link to WormBase or extract information
      for data-mining purposes.  You can link to HTML pages, text-only
      dumps and XML pages. For documentation regarding linking and
      mining WormBase (eg., mining WormBase with AcePerl, mining
      WormBase with MySQL and PostgreSQL, etc.) please see: <a
      href="http://aceserver.cshl.org/about/linking.html#aceperl">http://aceserver.cshl.org/about/linking.html#aceperl</a></p>

    <h3>An update on the sequencing status of the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> genomes</h3>
    <p>

      The whole genome shotgun sequencing phase of <i>C. remanei
      </i> has been completed and
      the ~1.43 million reads can be searched using BLAST at <a
      href="http://genome.wustl.edu/blast/client.pl">http://genome.wustl.edu/blast/client.pl</a>.  Fosmid end reads are in progress to
      be followed by two rounds of automated finishing, which should
      result in a high-quality draft assembly by the end of the
      summer.  <i>C. japonica</i> and CB5161 are being backcrossed and
      checked for heterozygosity.  These genomes are scheduled for
      whole genome shotgun sequencing in August and December,
      respectively.</p>

    <h3>A second mirror site for WormBase</h3>

    <p>A second mirror site for WormBase has been set up at the
    California Institute of Technology, Pasadena (<a
    href="http://caltech.wormbase.org/">http://caltech.wormbase.org</a>).
    This site and the first mirror site at the Institute of Molecular
    Biology and Biotechnology in Crete, Greece (<a
    href="http://worm.imbb.forth.gr/">http://worm.imbb.forth.gr</a>)
    act as back-up servers and will promote greater accessibility to
    WormBase.</p>
    
    <h3>Submitting your data to WormBase</h3>
    <p>WormBase provides on-line data-submission forms for the easy
    and quick submission of data from individual users.  We would like
    to encourage you to use these forms and provide us with feedback
    on their ease of use and information content.  This would help us
    improve and further develop this resource.  Forms are available to
    submit genetic map data (like allele data, deletion/duplication
    data, SNP map data, etc.), transgene data, new/altered locus data,
    etc.  For a complete list of data submission forms and contacts
    please see <a
    href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/curate/base">http://www.wormbase.org/db/curate/base</a>.
      </p>
    <p>
      For submission of large scale data sets, please contact WormBase
      directly.</p>

    <h3>Using the power of Textpresso to search the <i>C. elegans</i> literature via 'category' based
queries</h3>
    <p>
      Textpresso now has 3,810 full text worm papers.  In addition to
      the commonly used 'key-word' search, Textpresso allows searching
      of the literature based on 'categories'. This is a powerful
      feature and returns 'facts' about the entity (eg., a gene) you
      are interested in. For example, from the simple retrieval page
      of Textpresso (<a
      href="http://www.textpresso.org/">http://www.textpresso.org/</a>)
      you can use the keyword (query), 'let-23' and specify the
      categories 'regulation', 'cell or cellgroup' and 'molecular
      function'.  Performing the search returns 245 matches in 113
      publications (matches can be viewed in the sentences in which
      they occur along with the surrounding sentences).</p>
