    <h2>WormBase Newsletter #7, November 2004</h2>

    <h3>WormBase moves to a three-week release cycle</h3>
    <p><img width=148 height=141 src="images/image002.jpg" align=left hspace=16>
    <p>WormBase has moved to having an interval of three
      weeks between version releases, for a trial period until the end of 2004.</p>
    
    <h3>Vancouver GFP data set in WormBase</h3>
    <p>
      WormBase has added 827 GFP expression patterns generated by the
      groups of David Baillie and Don Moerman into the WS134 release (<a
									 href="http://tock.bcgsc.bc.ca/cgi-bin/ce2/eprofile">http://tock.bcgsc.bc.ca/cgi-bin/ce2/eprofile</a>)
      of the database. Ninety-one of these experiments have pictures. We
      will continue to add new data as and when they are made
      available.</p>
    
    <h3>New genome-wide RNAi data set based on an ORFeome library in WormBase</h3>
    <p>
      The results from the systematic RNAi screen reported in PMID:
      15489339, Rual <i>et al</i> "Toward improving <i>Caenorhabditis
      elegans</i> phenome
      mapping with an ORFeome-based RNAi library" are now available in
      WormBase. There are 10951 experiments, 1066 of which show a
      mutant phenotype.  See an example at:</p>

    <h3>Status of the WormBook project</h3>
    <p>
      WormBook, a collection of original reviews on a range of
      <i>C. elegans</i>-related
      topics, as well as a methods component (WormMethods), is on
      target for its late-spring release. The WormBook project is
      gaining momentum with approximately 27 of the 131 chapters
      planned for its first version submitted and currently being
      reviewed.</p>

    <h3>Status of KOG data in WormBase</h3>
    <p>
      WormBase has finished importing the conserved eukaryotic
      orthology groups (KOGs), candidate two-species orthology groups
      (TWOGs), and lineage-specific gene expansions (LSEs) from NCBI,
      so that both worm and non-worm members are available with
      up-to-date accession numbers.  This data set includes 16,209
      up-to-date <i>C. elegans </i> proteins, with only 166 remaining
      obsolete <i>C. elegans</i>
      proteins; in addition, there are 44,721 up-to-date non-worm
      proteins.  The accession numbers for the non-worm proteins are
      derived from Ensembl and Uniprot, with some residual Refseq
      identifiers where necessary.  The proteins fall into 4,852 KOGs,
      225 TWOGs, and 848 LSEs.</p>
    
    <h3>Sequencing status of <i>C. remanei</i> and other worm genomes</h3>
    
    <p>In the last year NHGRI has funded draft sequencing and assembly
    of 5 nematode genomes;<i>C. remanei, C. japonica, CB5161,
    Pristionchus pacificus</i>, and <i>Trichinella spiralis</i>.  All
    five will be sequenced at the Genome Sequencing Center at
    Washington University in St. Louis (<a
    href="http://genome.wustl.edu/">http://genome.wustl.edu/</a>).  An
    overview of the project and links to the sequencing proposal for
    the <i>Caenorhaditis species</i> is available at <a
    href="http://www.genome.gov/11007952">http://www.genome.gov/11007952</a>
    . The sequencing proposal for the basal nematodes is available at:
    <a
    href="ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/groups/analysis/basal_nematodes/basalnematodes.doc">ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/groups/analysis/basal_nematodes/basalnematodes.doc</a></p>
    <p>
      The whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing phase for
      <i>C. remanei</i> was completed early in the summer. The WGS
      reads and assembly can be searched at <a
      href="http://genome.wustl.edu/blast/client.pl">http://genome.wustl.edu/blast/client.pl</a>. Fosmid
      end sequences were recently completed and are in the process of
      being assembled with the WGS reads.  The resulting assembly will
      then be deposited in GenBank.  Two rounds of automated
      primer-directed sequence improvement will be done to close gaps
      and improve low-quality regions, followed by a final assembly
      and submission to
      GenBank.  This is expected to be completed early next year.
      <i>Pristionchus</i>
      libraries have been made and will be sequenced this
      month. Preparation of DNA for the other three species is in
      progress, with sequencing scheduled for later this year and
      early next year.  Questions about the sequencing can be sent to
      John Spieth (jspieth@watson.wustl.edu).</p>

    <h3>An update on the <i>C. elegans</i> literature search engine, Textpresso</h3>

    Textpresso, a search engine for <i>C. elegans</i> literature which
    provides full text searching and a novel 'ontology query'
    function, is expanding to other biological domains. A version of
    Textpresso for 14,000 yeast papers is being built at the
    Saccharomyces Genome Database, Stanford, CA. Work will begin at
    the end of this month to build a version for fly literature at
    Flybase, Harvard, MA. These new databases will
    be available to the public in the new year.</p>

    <h3>Sequencing of  Parasitic nematode genomes</h3>
   <p>
      The Genome Sequencing Center (GSC) at Washington University has
      been awarded a 4 year grant from NIH-NIAID to further its
      analysis of parasitic nematode genomes. Since 1999, the GSC has
      generated over 245,000 ESTs from 28 nematode species. Included
      in the new proposal is funding to improve our <a
      href="http://www.nematode.net/">www.nematode.net</a> database
      effort, and better integrate it with WormBase and nembase
      (www.nematodes.org).  The purpose is to provide parasitologists
      and other nematologists with bioinformatics databases and tools
      that are user-friendly, integrated, and lasting. Project
      investigators include Richard Wilson (PI), Sandra Clifton, James
      McCarter, Robert Waterston, and Makedonka Mitreva (Group
      Leader). For questions, contact
      mmitreva@watson.wustl.edu.</p>

    <h3>Latest freeze version of WormBase</h3>
    <p>
      WS130 is the fourth and latest freeze version of WormBase.  WS130 can be accessed at: <a href="http://ws130.wormbase.org/">http://ws130.wormbase.org</a>.</p>
