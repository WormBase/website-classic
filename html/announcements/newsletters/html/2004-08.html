    <h2>WormBase Newsletter #6, August 2004</h2>

    <h3>The <i>C. elegans</i> genome is complete!</h3>
    <p><img width=148 height=141 src="images/image002.jpg" align=left hspace=16>
      The WS126 release of WormBase last month featured a complete
      genome with no gaps remaining in the genome sequence.</p>

    <h3>WormBase launches the 'WormBook' project</h3>
    <p>
      WormBook is a new online review of <i>C. elegans </i> biology.
      This open-access project will feature original reviews of
      <i>C. elegans</i>-related articles written by leading
      <i>C. elegans</i> biologists and will fill an existing
      information gap for <i>C. elegans</i> researchers, the general
      scientific community and educators as well as providing a
      narrative to WormBase.  WormBook will also include
      'WormMethods', a repository for experimental methods and
      techniques.  WormBook will be extensively hyperlinked into and
      out of WormBase.  The initial version of WormBook will be
      available online by May 2005.  Martin Chalfie is
      Editor-in-Chief, Victor Ambros is Editor of WormMethods and Lisa
      Girard is Editor and will be the main contact person.</p>

    <h3>WormBase introduces stable gene identifiers</h3>
    <p>
      The WS126 release of WormBase last month introduced gene
      identifiers for every gene, e.g., WBGene00000001 for
      <i>aap-1</i>.  Such stable gene identifiers facilitate the easy
      tracking of the 'history' of a gene as the WBGene identifier
      will be retained in the database even when the corresponding
      gene prediction is removed due to a gene split, merger or
      obsoletion.  Though this process involved major changes in the
      data model and extensive testing of the performance of the
      database, this does not change the way in which searching and
      querying for genes is done.</p>

    <h3>WormBase introduces several new features and displays </h3>
    <p>
      The following features and displays have been added, any
      feedback as to how these could be improved is
      welcome.</p>
    
    <p>
      1. A site map provides a list of displays and searches along with a
      brief description: <a
      href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/misc/site_map">http://www.wormbase.org/db/misc/site_map</a></p>
    <p>
      2.  The 'Batch Genes' Query page (<a
      href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/searches/batch_genes">http://www.wormbase.org/db/searches/batch_genes</a>)
      retrieves batch information for a given set of genes, proteins
      or transcripts.  This query has been improved to increase speed
      of retrieval, and now can retrieve several new data categories
      like concise description, subcellular localization, Gene
      Ontology terms, strains, transgene, etc.  Retrieved information
      can be saved to spread-sheets or in tab-delimited text
      form.</p>
    <p>3. New displays have been added for:</p>
    <p>
      --Microarray Data: <a
      href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/microarray/results">http://www.wormbase.org/db/microarray/results</a></p>
      <p>--Life Stage Summary: <a
      href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/misc/life_stage">http://www.wormbase.org/db/misc/life_stage</a></p>
    <p>--Gene Regulation: <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/regulation">http://www.wormbase.org/db/gene/regulation</a></p>

    <p>--Information Update for the
lineage of <i>C. elegans</i> scientists: <a
href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/misc/person">http://www.wormbase.org/db/misc/person</a></p>
    
<p>4. A 'Glossary' that lists terms and their definitions as used in WormBase:</p>

    <h3>New microarray probe data set added</h3>
    <p>
      Affymetrix GeneChip and Washington University GSC microarray
      probe set information is now available in WormBase. The data can
      be accessed from the ‘Reagents’ section of the Gene Summary page
      and on the Genome Browser.</p>

    <h3>Eukaryotic Orthologous Group data from NCBI added to WormBase</h3>
    <p>
      Eukaryotic orthologous groups from NCBI (about 5,924 in number)
      have been updated and added to WormBase.  These include
      universal groups (KOGs) found in all metazoa or all eukaryotes,
      two-species orthology groups (TWOGS) that are nevertheless
      ancient (e.g., orthologies found only between worm and fly, or
      worm and human) and lineage-specific expansions of genes
      peculiar to <i>C. elegans</i> (LSEs).  These data are visible on the
      gene summary page under the section 'NCBI KOGs'.</p>
    
    <h3>An update on the <i>C. elegans</i> literature search engine 'Textpresso'</h3>

    <p>Textpresso (<a
    href="http://www.textpresso.org/">http://www.textpresso.org</a>)
    has added 610 new full-text papers and 958 new abstracts bringing
    the total number of papers and abstracts to 4,420 and 17,700,
    respectively.</p>
    
    <h3>Latest version freeze of  WormBase is WS120</h3>
    <p>
      We would like to remind our users that WormBase offers version
      freezes.  Every tenth release is available, so that
      bioinformaticians can refer to and work with a particular
      version of the <i>C. elegans</i> genome (e.g., <a
      href="http://ws120.wormbase.org/">http://ws120.wormbase.org</a>).</p>
