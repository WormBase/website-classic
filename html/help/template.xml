Help files contain tooltip contents that are served for ajax 
requests to populate tooltip balloons or offer other dynamic content.
They are parsed by /cgi-perl/misc/help.

Each page or script gets its own xml file and each help item
is contained in a section element.  Each section ID must be
unique in this file. Note the CDATA to hide
html markup from the XML parser. 


FILE NAME FORMAT:

example: the "/db/gene/gene" script will have a help file named "db-gene-gene.xml";

-->

<xml>
 <section section_id="help_message0"> 
  <![CDATA[
    <b>Help 0:</b> 
    Blah Blah Blech. I am here to help. <i> Please let me help </i>
  ]]>
 </section>
 
 <section section_id="help_message1">
  <![CDATA[
    <b>Help 1:</b>
    If you thought the other message was helpful, try me!
    I am <b>MUCH</b> more helpful.
  ]]>
 </section>
