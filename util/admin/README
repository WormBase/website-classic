The scripts in this directory perform various administration
related tasks for a WormBase installation.

acedb.xinetd       This is a default configuration file for running
                   acedb under xinetd. It should be copied to 
                   /etc/xinetd.d/acedb

For systems that use initd:

blat_server.initd  This script works with restart_blat.pl to
                   restart the blat server.  It should be placed
                   under /etc/rc.d/init.d and named blat_server.
                   If your system lacks the /etc/rc.d, ignore this step.

restart_blat.pl
restart_mysqld.pl
                   These two scripts are intended to be run as
                   cron jobs, periodically monitoring the blat
                   and mysql servers. Place the follwing commands
                   under the crontab of a priviliged user:

    0 * * * * /usr/local/wormbase/util/admin/restart_mysql.pl
    0 * * * * /usr/local/wormbase/util/admin/restart_blat.pl
