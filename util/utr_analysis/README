1. Run propose_utr.pl against live GFF database (WS78) and record
result in proposed_utrs.txt.  Took a couple of hours to run.

2. Run close_gaps.pl against proposed_utrs.txt to close up gaps from
EST misalignments.  This removes gaps less than 5 bp in length
(probably should be even more aggressive).  Store result in
proposed_utrs_gaps_closed.txt.

3. Run consolidate_utrs.pl against proposed_utrs_gaps_closed.txt.
This joins partially coding with implied coding UTRs and trims the UTR
to end one base adjacent to the CDS.  It also reverses start and end
so that orientation of UTRs is correct.  Store result into
consolidated_utrs.txt.

4. Run to_gff.pl to put it into GFF format.  This swaps the
orientation again, and assigns strandedness.  Final output in utrs.gff.
