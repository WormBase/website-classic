WormBase log analysis

---------------------------------------------
Analyzing logs on a per-release basis
---------------------------------------------
Typically, at the end of a release cycle, you should update
the log analysis. You can do this by:

  % /usr/local/wormbase/logs/analyze_logs.sh WSXXX
  
(See the bottom of analyze_logs.sh for complete examples
for different scenarios)

analyze_logs.sh will:

  1. Concatenate the current logs to a single file, access_log.WSXXX.gz
       (via concatenate_logs.sh)
  2. Do hostname lookups (via add_hostnames.pl)
  3. Do log analysis on the release (using analog)
  4. Calculate the most popular genes for the current release
  5. Create reports and graphs at html/stats/WSXXX/ using report magic

  6. Concatenate the current logs to the current running year
  7. Do log analysis and report generation for year-to-date
  8. Do log analysis and report generation for total accesses

The scripts and files that make this process happen are:

concatenate_logs.sh
   Concatenates all the logs for a current release, generating 
   logs/archive/accesss_log.WSXXX.gz

 % concatenate_logs.sh WS130

most_popular_genes.pl
    Calculate the most popular genes for a given time period
     
 % most_popular_genes.pl \
	-logs /usr/local/wormbase/logs/access_log \
	-output /usr/local/wormbase/html/stats/WS130/ \
	-release WS130 \
	-format HTML

analog.conf and analog-yearly.conf
    Configuration files for analog-based log analysis. The misnamed
    "analog-yearly.conf" should be used for periods less than one 
    year. It excludes the "YEARLY" stats.

rmagic.conf
    Configuration file for report magic-based generation of charts



For releases that bracket a year, the release needs to be split from
one year to the next. Sorry, this should be robust enough to handle this.

For the second half of the release in the new year.

1. Concatenate the logs using concatenate_logs.sh

    concatenate_logs.sh WSXXX

2. ./extract_daterange.pl 01/Jan/2005 12/Dec/2005 \
    'zcat /usr/local/wormbase/logs/archive/raw/access_log.WS136.gz |' \
    | gzip -c > /usr/local/wormbase/logs/archive/raw/access_log.2005-cumulative.gz 

3. Modify the analyze_logs.sh so as not to repeat the log
concatenation(actually occurs in two places)

etc, etc, etc.  Total pain.

What follows is Lincoln's original log analysis tools
(some of which are used above)

--

1) Run add_hostnames.pl and redirect output to a file.  This runs the resolver
on the IP addresses.  Suggest:

    mkdir 2003
    add_hostnames.pl |gzip -c > 2003/access_log_through_10_march_2003.gz

NOTE: This takes a long time to run (maybe overnight).  It might be better to
run extract_datarange.pl FIRST and then to run add_hostnames.pl.

2) Run wormbase_stats.pl on the file you just created:

   wormbase_stats.pl 2003/access_log_through_10_march_2003.gz > 2003/host_stats.txt

   This will give the list of hits, sorted by month, but the rest of the data
   will be the WHOLE PROJECT.

3) Extract a recent period, say last six complete months:

   extract_daterange.pl 01/Sep/2002 28/Feb/2003 \
	'zcat 2003/access_log_through_10_march_2003.gz |' \
	| gzip -c > 2003/access_log_sep2002_feb2003.gz

Be careful with this, because the dates are pattern matches and the
file must be sorted in chronological order.

4) Run wormbase_stats.pl to get recent stats

   wormbase_stats.pl 2003/access_log_sep2002_feb2003.gz > 2003/host_stats_recent.txt

3) Run tally_hosts.pl on the file to get domain list:

   tally_hosts.pl 2003/host_stats_recent.txt > 2003/domains.txt

4) Run tally_referers.pl on the file to get domain list:

   tally_referers.pl 2003/host_stats_recent.txt > 2003/referers.txt
