// This file contains information needed to
// control the credentials of the clients connecting
// to the acedb server

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// DATA_VERSION
// If data_version is larger than the one encountered previously
// the graphic clients will attempt to refresh their data
// If you run a rather static server, for distant clients
//  reset this number only after every major data change
// If you run a continuous server on which clients have write access
// set this number to zero, then the session number of the server
// will be used to trigger refresh,
// anyway all objects on the client are refreshed before any edition

DATA_VERSION 0  // ZERO for continuous refresh mode

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// WRITE ACCESS:
// You must specify a directory that will be readable by
// any client to which you want to grant access

// WRITE_ACCESS_DIRECTORY  /tmp

// On first connection from a client
// the server will write there very short temporary pass file 640
// The client must read this file before his second connection
// the server then destroys it.

// hence the correct way to set up things is to 
// ensure that all users and the server process 
// belong to the same group and that the client can mount the
// WRITE_ACCESS_DIRECTORY. 
// This effectivelly restrict access to a set of user on trusted 
// machines.

// Since the pass file is dynamic and modified each time
// you cannot crack it by multiple retries.

// Example
//  WRITE_ACCESS_DIRECTORY  /tmp
// everybody logged on the server machine can write
//
// ATTENTION
//  /tmp is not a good choice, because clients on other machine will wait
//  for a few seconds for the pass file to appear in their own /tmp
//  A more fancy directory name is likely to be absent on the client
//  machine, and the client will proceed without waiting

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// READ ACCESS:
// There are 3 possibilities:
// 1: If you set READ_ACCESS_DIRECTORY PUBLIC

READ_ACCESS_DIRECTORY PUBLIC

// any client will have read access

// 2: If you specify a READ_ACCESS_DIRECTORY directory
//   for example READ_ACCESS_DIRECTORY /tmp
// The same strategy as for write access is used, and
// you can therefore limit read access to those users who
// can read a given directory.

// 3: If you set READ_ACCESS_DIRECTORY RESTRICTED 
//   or if the READ_ACCESS_DIRECTORY clause is missing
//   only client with write access will have read access.

// Example
//  READ_ACCESS_DIRECTORY  /tmp
// everybody logged on the server machine can read

// The following lines are used by the xclient
// To run this system, you need to have rpc installed on your
// UNIX machine. 
// Normally these lines are automatically filled
// by the script wtools/xcl which as of may 97 is the way
// to start the graphic xclient
// 
// As an example we give here the Montpellier worm server address

// EXTERNAL_SERVER 193.49.189.62
// EXTERNAL_PORT   20000100
